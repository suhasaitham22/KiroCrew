"""The MDM-managed tier, and the tighten-only composition rule beneath it.

Covers the top precedence tier added to ``load_security_policy`` and the
composition primitive every lower tier now goes through:

* the tier is **inert** with no managed file, so every standalone install is
  unaffected (this is the property that makes the tier free to ship);
* the trust checks on a *present* managed file -- regular file, root-owned, not
  group/world-writable, not a symlink, size-bounded -- and the fact that each
  failure **raises** instead of falling through to a lower, possibly permissive
  tier, which is the entire security property;
* both document encodings the tier accepts (macOS ``.plist``, JSON elsewhere);
* ``_intersect_ceilings``: a subordinate may add restrictions and may not remove
  one, and everything outside ``controls`` stays the authority's;
* ``BreakGlass``: the dated, authority-issued grant that is the ONLY way a lower
  tier outranks the authority.

**Nothing here touches a real managed path.** The autouse fixture points
``_managed_policy_path`` and ``_policy_home_path`` at nonexistent files under
``tmp_path`` before every test, so a dev machine that happens to have
``/etc/kirocrew/security_policy.json`` cannot make an assertion here read a
document this module never wrote. There is deliberately no environment override
for the managed path, so the function seam is the only way to aim it.
