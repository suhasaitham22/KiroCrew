    PRIVATE, and it must stay private. ``instances/run_marker`` states the rule:
    no "is something listening" helper may be offered, because a caller will
    mistake reachability for identity -- and ``pod``'s own health probe was held
    to that rule for exactly this reason. This function is not exempt by being
    inverted: "nobody is listening" is equally useless as an identity signal, and
    a free port says nothing about who WOULD answer on a busy one.

    So the only caller is :func:`allocate_port`, whose question genuinely is
    binding and nothing else: it is choosing a port to hand a process that has not
    started yet.

    ``SO_REUSEADDR`` is set to MIRROR THE ACTUAL BINDER. A pod's gateway serves
    through ``aiohttp``'s ``TCPSite``, which leaves ``reuse_address`` at its
    asyncio default -- set on POSIX -- so the gateway can bind a port whose only
    occupant is a ``TIME_WAIT`` remnant. A probe without the option is therefore
    STRICTER than the process it is probing for, and the difference is not
    academic: ``pod down`` followed by ``pod up`` leaves the previous gateway's
    accepted connections in ``TIME_WAIT`` on exactly that port, so every quick
    restart would read as a collision and relocate the pod off its derived port
    for nothing. ``instances/port_allocator.py`` documents the same reasoning for
    the SSH forward. ``SO_REUSEADDR`` exempts ``TIME_WAIT`` only, never a live
    ``LISTEN``, so a real collision is still caught.

    That last sentence is POSIX, and deliberately not hedged: on Windows the option
    means something closer to ``SO_REUSEPORT`` and would let this bind succeed
    against a LIVE listener, inverting the answer. It is unguarded because it is
    unreachable -- ``require_backend`` refuses pods on any host without
    ``systemd --user`` or ``launchd``, so nothing calls this there. Anyone reusing
    this probe outside the pod plane has to revisit that.

    Raises :class:`PodError` when the probe cannot be RUN at all -- socket creation
    or option-setting failing, e.g. on file-descriptor exhaustion. That is not the
    same as a port being busy and must not be coerced into ``False``: answering
    "not free" for a probe that never happened would silently relocate a pod on no
    evidence. ``instances/port_allocator.py`` states the same rule for its own probe
    -- "neither answer is true, so it propagates to the caller instead of being
    coerced into one". ``allocate_port`` lets it through and ``pod up`` turns it into
    a refusal, so the operator sees why rather than a traceback.

    this", which is different from "read it and it names no port".

    Separate from :func:`read_env_file` because the trust posture differs. That

    path the CLAIM SCAN found by globbing the pods directory, so the set of files
    read is decided by directory contents rather than by a person -- and this runs in
    the trusted CLI, outside the hooks gate that governs an agent's own reads. A
    symlink planted there would therefore make a privileged process read its target.

    So the open carries ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (a symlink raises ``ELOOP`` and is skipped)
    rather than an ``is_symlink()`` pre-check, which would leave a window between the
    check and the open -- AND ``O_NONBLOCK``, because ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does nothing
    about a FIFO: a named pipe is not a symlink, and a plain ``O_RDONLY`` open of one
    BLOCKS until a writer appears, which would hang every ``pod up`` on the plane
    indefinitely rather than merely reading the wrong bytes. Measured: the blocking
    form never returns, the non-blocking form returns at once.
    ``O_NONBLOCK`` has no effect on reading a regular file, so it costs the normal
    path nothing.

    Nonblocking alone only stops the hang, so the descriptor is then ``fstat``-ed and
    anything that is not a REGULAR file is refused -- a FIFO, a device, a directory.
    That is the check that makes "this is a pod's env file" true rather than assumed.

    The read is bounded, and every failure -- missing, unreadable, symlink, FIFO,
    undecodable -- answers ``None``, because "this peer has no claim I can read" is
    the safe answer and matches :func:`read_env_file`'s fail-open contract.

    The value goes through :func:`_port_from_env`, so every crash guard lives in one
    place. The RANGE check is this function's own policy: a value that cannot be a

    and knows when to record the new choice.

    Why this exists: the derivation maps every name into 199 slots
    (``base + (cksum(name) % 199) + 1``), so two worktree names colliding mod 199
    is an ordinary event, not a pathological one, and the derived port can equally
    be held by something that is not a pod at all. Without this, the loser's
    gateway exits "address already in use" and its unit crash-loops -- while
    ``pod url`` keeps printing the shared port, so the operator is pointed at a
    pod that is not the one they just built.

    The answer is recorded by the caller as a ``PORT=`` pin, which
    :func:`derive_port` already prefers over derivation. That is what keeps every
    later reader agreeing without being changed: the pin mechanism predates this
    function and is the reason the fallback needs no new plumbing.

    **An automatic pin is not an operator pin.** A fallback this function chose is
    recorded alongside :data:`AUTO_PORT_KEY`, and a later call will relocate it
    like any other busy port. Without that distinction one transient occupant of
    the derived port -- a ``TIME_WAIT`` remnant, another process for a minute --
    would pin the pod off its derived slot permanently, and every later collision
    on the fallback would hit the "never moved automatically" refusal for a
    decision the operator never made. An operator's OWN ``PORT=`` is still never
    relocated: that would defeat the reason it was pinned.

    THIS FUNCTION ONLY CHOOSES. It writes nothing, so the caller can record the
    choice in the same env write it already performs, inside the lock it already
    holds. Note the probe cannot RESERVE: the port is released before the pod's
    gateway binds it, so see :func:`pod_plane_mutex` for what closes that window

    :func:`pod_name_mutex` is per name, which is the right grain for the pin +
    definition + start transaction it guards -- two different pods have no reason
    to serialize their lifecycles. Port allocation is the exception: it is the one
    step where two DIFFERENT names contend, because they contend for the band
    rather than for each other's state.

    Without this, two colliding names ``up``'d concurrently (Dev Fleet's normal
    shape) hold disjoint name locks, both probe the same port free, and both boot
    onto it -- exactly the crash-loop :func:`allocate_port` exists to prevent.
    ``apps/backend.py``'s ``_reserve_free_port`` carries the same lesson one
    subsystem over: "Probing without reserving ... lets two apps be handed the same
    port -- both children then bind it and the loser dies with EADDRINUSE."

    Implemented by BORROWING :func:`pod_name_mutex` under a reserved name rather
    than copying its body: the two differ only in the key, and a second
    hand-maintained copy would drift the moment either grew a feature. The key,
    lock file, reentrancy and lock ordering are therefore identical by
    construction rather than by review.

    **What this does NOT close, stated rather than implied.** The probe releases
    the port before the pod's gateway binds it, and the gateway is a separate
    process, so no lock held here can span the choose->bind gap; a unit is
    ``Type=simple``, so ``start_pod`` returns before the bind. Holding this until a
    health check confirmed the bind WOULD close it, at the cost of serializing
    every pod boot on the plane behind up to 45 health polls of the previous one.
    What closes most of the gap instead is :func:`_walk_band_for_free` consulting
    the pins already recorded on disk, so a concurrent claim is visible before its
    gateway is listening. See that function for the residue that remains.

    Held INSIDE :func:`pod_name_mutex` wherever both are taken, so the acquisition
    order is always name -> plane and cannot deadlock against a second holder.

    The proof is pid identity, the same shape ``port_resolution._gateway_owns_port``
    uses for the live gateway: the process listening on the port must be the pod's
    own (:func:`main_pid`). Three branches are worth naming.

    **Ownership is scoped to the address the probe talked to.** A port NUMBER can
    carry several LISTEN sockets on different local addresses, so "some process of
    ours holds this port" is not the question -- the question is who a
    ``127.0.0.1`` connect reaches. ``loopback_owner_pids`` answers exactly that,
    mirroring the kernel's most-specific-bind dispatch. Taking every pid on the
    port instead would let a pod bound to one specific local address vouch for a
    foreign listener holding ``127.0.0.1`` on the same port -- the squatter would
    be trusted BECAUSE the real pod exists elsewhere on that number. This scope
    must stay in step with the address :func:`_probe_health` dials.

    **A pod with no process, on a port somebody holds, is FOREIGN -- not
    unproven.** This is the whole bug. A pod whose gateway lost the bind race has
    no process at all, so there is no pid to match; if the answer were "cannot
    tell" the squatter's 200 would still be reported as this pod's health, which
    is exactly the state this function exists to name. A non-empty listener list
    plus a pod that authoritatively has no pid IS proof the responder is someone
    else.

    **Undecidable stays undecidable.** No ``lsof``/``netstat``, a throwing
    lookup, or a service manager that cannot be asked all return
    :data:`OWNER_UNPROVEN`. Each caller then decides for itself: :func:`health`
    keeps its pre-identity behaviour, because refusing would turn every pod on
    such a host into a permanently unhealthy one -- a self-inflicted outage in
    place of a misreport -- while :func:`mint_token`, which hands over a
    credential, requires positive proof. That mirrors
    ``cli_server._replacement_is_serving`` applying its listener check "only where
    it can pass", and ``port_resolution._gateway_owns_port`` failing closed on the

# `pod exec` forwards to a real kirocrew, so it inherits the WHOLE CLI — including
# verbs that manage the HOST rather than any one instance. This is an ALLOWLIST
# rather than a denylist because the set of host-scoped verbs is open-ended (a
# by-name denylist repeatedly missed verbs — `stop`, then `restart`, then
# `service`): every verb below acts only on `KIROCREW_HOME` state, which
# `pod exec` has already pointed at the pod.
# Anything else — present or newly added — is refused until it is deliberately
# listed, so the failure mode of drift is "temporarily unavailable" rather than
# "silently operated on the user's live machine".
#
# Deliberately EXCLUDED, with the reason each is host-scoped, not pod-scoped:
#   setup, update  — rewrite the install and the ~/.local/bin launcher
#   app            — `apps/bridges.py` edits `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`, the
#                    HOST registry, which is NOT covered by KIROCREW_HOME or
#                    KIRO_HOME. (The app agent JSONs it symlinks now follow
#                    `kiro_agents_dir()`, so those land under the pod's own
#                    KIRO_HOME — but the settings registry still does not, so a
#                    pod install/uninstall would still mutate host state.)
#   stop, restart  — service-aware: `cli_server._stop` short-circuits to
#                    systemctl when no explicit --port is passed, so they hit the
#                    LIVE gateway; and `restart` additionally leaves a DETACHED
#                    replacement that `pod down` cannot stop
#   service        — installs/removes the machine-wide systemd unit
#   gateway        — would race a second gateway against the pod's own unit
#   pod            — pod management from inside a pod (a nested `pod down` would
#                    tear down its own supervisor)
#   cloud          — provisions resources in the user's AWS account
#   browse         — writes browser auth state outside KIROCREW_HOME
#   manifest       — emits a Slack app manifest tied to the real identity
#   run            — `task_reporter.save_progress` writes `TASK_PROGRESS.md`
#                    "next to the spec file" (`Path(run.spec_path).parent`), so
#                    `run /host/TASK.md` writes `/host/TASK_PROGRESS.md`. An
#                    IMPLICIT write outside the pod, derived from a path the user
#                    supplied as an input rather than a destination.
#   snapshot       — its destination is CONFIGURABLE (`snapshot_dir`, or a
#                    positional dir) and `--keep N` DELETES older archives beyond
#                    N. `sanitized_seed_config` only forces tunnel/telegram/wecom
#                    off, so a pod seeded from the live config inherits the user's
#                    real backup directory — `snapshot --keep 1` from a pod would
#                    prune live backups. Destructive and cross-plane.
#   doctor         — NOT read-only: `cli_doctor.py:126` does
#                    `atomic_write(agent_path, ...)` where `agent_path` is
#                    `KIRO_AGENTS_DIR / AGENT_FILENAME` (line 405), i.e. under the
#                    real HOME. It auto-adds missing MCP servers, so a pod
#                    `doctor` rewrites the LIVE agent configuration.
#   tui, chat      — `cli_chat._tui` resolves its port as
#                    `getattr(args, "port", None) or cfg…get("port", 5476)` — the
#                    CONFIG dashboard port, falling back to literal 5476, never
#                    `KIROCREW_PORT`. A pod's config names no dashboard port, so it
#                    lands on the LIVE gateway. `chat` is excluded too because
#                    `chat --tui` branches straight into `_tui` (cli.py:1818), so
#                    excluding only `tui` left the same hole open. Every OTHER
#                    client verb (`status`, `logout`, and the credential verb) goes
#                    through `port_resolution.resolve_client_port`, which DOES honour
#                    `KIROCREW_PORT` — so this hazard is confined to `_tui`.
#   logs           — `cli_server._logs_cmd` runs `journalctl -u <SERVICE_NAME>`,
#                    the HOST service unit, so inside a pod it would show the LIVE
#                    gateway's journal while appearing to show the pod's. Wrong
#                    answer rather than damage, but a confidently wrong one.
#                    `kirocrew pod logs NAME` reads the pod's own unit.
#   mcp-*          — stdio server entrypoints, not user-facing commands
#
# `agent` and `workspace` ARE listed: both dispatchers were checked and operate
# only on `config_dir()` state (the config.json agents/workspaces maps), never on
# `~/.kiro/agents`. `workspace` is safe specifically because it asserts every
# source and destination `is_relative_to(config_dir())`; without that guard it
# would belong with `snapshot`. `restore` is listed because although its SOURCE
# archive path is arbitrary, that is a read — everything it writes lands in
# `config_dir()`.
#
# The inclusion test, stated once so it does not have to be rediscovered. A verb
# qualifies only if BOTH hold:
#   (a) every path it writes IMPLICITLY — anywhere the user did not name as a
#       destination — is inside `config_dir()`; and
#   (b) it deletes nothing outside `config_dir()`.
# An explicitly-named output destination is fine (`memory export -o FILE` writes
# where the user pointed it, no differently from shell redirection). What fails is
# an implicit write derived from an INPUT path (`run` → `TASK_PROGRESS.md` beside
# the spec), a host registry (`app`), a host service (`service`, `stop`,
# `restart`), a deletion driven by config (`snapshot --keep`), or a host-scoped
# read that merely LOOKS pod-scoped (`logs`).
