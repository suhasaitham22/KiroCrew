# `kirocrew pod` — isolated worktree test instances

Spin up a **throwaway, full-stack KiroCrew gateway** for any feature worktree —
its own port, its own `KIROCREW_HOME` (own DB / sessions / memory), no Slack
tunnel, `--no-crons` (unless you pass `--crons`), resource-capped, and reclaimed
by `pod down`. Test a branch's
backend `/api/*` **and** the SPA bundle it serves, all **without touching your
live gateway or your shared `~/.kiro/crew` data**.

Think **`kubectl` for local worktree test rigs.** This is the *test line*
(multi-active, burn-on-evict); it is orthogonal to the *live line* (a single
gateway serving real data on the canonical port) and refuses to bind the live port.

## Interface

```bash
kirocrew pod install              # lay down the systemd --user template unit (once per machine)
kirocrew pod provision <wt>       # build the worktree's venv + SPA dist (the on-ramp)
kirocrew pod up   <wt> [--json]   # bring up an isolated pod → {base_url, token, port}
kirocrew pod up   <wt> --provision# provision (if needed) then bring it up
kirocrew pod up   <wt> --approval reads  # boot its gateway in an approval mode
kirocrew pod up   <wt> --crons          # boot its gateway with the cron scheduler on
kirocrew pod up   <wt> --seed rich      # pre-populate its HOME from a named scenario
kirocrew pod scenarios [--json]   # what `--seed <scenario>` accepts, with descriptions
kirocrew pod api  <wt> GET sessions     # one authenticated API call → JSON on stdout
kirocrew pod ls                   # what's running (≈ kubectl get pods) + orphaned HOMEs (with age)
kirocrew pod prune [--all] [--dry-run]  # bulk-reclaim orphaned HOMEs (default: older than 3d; --all for every age)
kirocrew pod status <wt>          # up/down + health
kirocrew pod token  <wt> [--ttl]  # (re)mint a dashboard token for a running pod
kirocrew pod url    <wt>          # print its base_url
kirocrew pod logs   <wt> [-n N]   # tail its journal
kirocrew pod down   <wt>          # evict → delete its HOME, verified (zero residue)
```

`<wt>` is a friendly worktree name. It is resolved to a checkout **git-natively**:
`kirocrew pod up <name>` matches a linked worktree by its directory basename, its
branch (`<name>` or `feat/<name>`), or an exact path — run it from inside any
KiroCrew checkout (or set `KIROCREW_POD_REPO`). The resolved path is pinned so the
pod's gateway boots without re-consulting git.

## The on-ramp (provisioning)

A worktree must be *built* before it can be podded — an editable
`.venv/bin/kirocrew` and a built SPA bundle (`src/kiro_crew/static/dist`). These
are intrinsic to "a worktree that can run a gateway at all"; pod just surfaces
and collapses them, honoring their very different costs:

| Prereq | Cost | Who builds it |
|---|---|---|
| **venv** | ~1 min, idempotent | `pod up` **auto-builds** it on demand |
| **dist** | minutes (Vite SPA build) | only on **explicit consent** |

So plain `pod up <wt>` builds the cheap venv for you but **fails loud** if the
dist is missing — pointing you at the slow build — while `pod up <wt> --provision`
(or `pod provision <wt>`) runs the full chain: venv + `npm run build` in
`website/` staged into the served `static/dist`.

## The agent front door: seed a state, then call the API

The three verbs an agent drives, in the order it drives them. Together they turn
"reproduce this, then check it" into two commands with no manual token handling
and no `curl` string to get wrong.

### `pod scenarios` — what states are available

```bash
kirocrew pod scenarios          # SCENARIO / DESCRIPTION table
kirocrew pod scenarios --json   # [{"name": …, "description": …}]
```

A **scenario** is a fixture shipped as package data in
`kiro_crew/tests_fixtures/<name>/`, each a valid `KIROCREW_HOME` tree with a
`fixture.yaml` whose `description` is what this listing prints. The same
fixtures back `kirocrew gateway --seed <name>` and
`kiro_crew.testing.fixtures.seeded_home`, so a state reproduced in a pod is the
same state a test can assert against. The registry is read from disk, so a
fixture added to the package appears here with nothing else to update.

### `pod up --seed <scenario>` — boot with that state already in place

```bash
kirocrew pod up my-wt --seed crons-active      # a NAME: populate the whole HOME
kirocrew pod up my-wt --seed ~/.kiro/crew      # a PATH: sanitized config.json only
```

`--seed` takes both forms and tells them apart **syntactically**: anything with
a path separator or a leading `~`/`.` is a directory, and a bare token is a
scenario name. The rule is syntactic rather than a filesystem lookup so the
control plane (`pod up`, which must refuse an unknown name before starting a
unit) and the pod's own `boot` cannot reach different verdicts. An unknown bare
name is **refused with the available list** — the alternative is a pod that
comes up blank and healthy, which an agent reads as the feature under test being
broken. To seed from a bare relative directory name, spell it as a path
(`--seed ./name`).

Both forms record one `SEED=` key, so re-`up`ing with the other form replaces
the value instead of leaving two keys to disagree. Seeding happens in `boot`,
after the HOME is created and before the gateway is exec'd, and a HOME that
already holds state is **never re-seeded** — otherwise a `Restart=on-failure`
re-exec would delete the sessions and logs of the crash being investigated. A
scenario's own `config.json` is put through the same `SEED_DISABLED_SECTIONS`
deny list as a directory seed, so no fixture can hand a pod a live channel.

### `pod api` — call it without touching the credential

```bash
kirocrew pod api my-wt GET sessions
kirocrew pod api my-wt GET /api/health
kirocrew pod api my-wt POST config --data '{"key":"agent.model"}'
```

Prints **one JSON document with fixed keys** on every outcome —
`{name, method, path, status, ok, body}` — so a caller never has to test which
of several shapes it got. `body` is the parsed response when it is JSON and the
raw text otherwise, which keeps a plain-text 500 readable. A non-2xx prints the
same document (the gateway's own error body included) and exits 1.

The path is normalized, so `sessions`, `/sessions`, `/api/sessions` and a full
`base_url` all work. The token is minted internally through the same
ownership-proof path `pod token` uses, so the agent never reads `.local_secret`
and a foreign process holding the derived port can never be authenticated
against. A pod that is not running is reported as exactly that, naming
`kirocrew pod up <wt>`; a pod that is up but unreachable points at
`pod status` / `pod logs` instead.

## A pod IS the worktree's gateway (control plane vs payload)

- **Control plane** — the `kirocrew pod` verbs (resolution, port derivation, unit
  management, token mint, boot *prep*). These run from the **stable, globally
  installed** `kirocrew`, so they never break just because a worktree's code is broken.
- **Payload** — the booted pod *is* the worktree's `.venv/bin/kirocrew gateway`. If
  the worktree's gateway can't start (bad import, broken config, unbuilt dist), the
  pod can't come up — **and that is correct**. `pod up` detects the crash fast,
  prints the gateway's own journal, stops the half-started unit, and tells you this
  is the worktree build failing — not the pod tool.

## Mechanism (Linux `systemd --user`)

`kirocrew pod install` writes a template unit `kirocrew-pod@.service` whose
`ExecStart` re-enters `kirocrew pod _run <wt>` (boot logic lives in
`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.boot`). `MemoryMax`/`CPUQuota` cap a runaway pod;
`Restart=on-failure` self-heals.

The unit has **no `ExecStopPost` teardown hook**, on purpose. systemd runs
`ExecStopPost` *before* the final kill of the unit's cgroup, so a hook that
deleted the pod's HOME raced the pod's own surviving subprocesses — they
recreated the directory by reopening their audit log in append mode — and it also
fired on the stop half of a `Restart=`, bringing the pod back on a home stripped
of its sessions and config. So `kirocrew pod down` owns reclamation on every
platform: it stops the service, waits for the unit's cgroup to drain, deletes the
HOME through `runtime.cleanup_home` (which re-validates the name and refuses
`..`/absolute/empty, since teardown safety must not rely on systemd `%i`
semantics), then VERIFIES the directory is gone and fails loudly if it is not.
The trade is that a pod which goes away without a `down` — a crash, a raw
`systemctl --user stop`, a reboot — leaves its HOME behind; `pod ls` reports
those with their age, `pod down <wt>` reclaims one, and `pod prune` reclaims
them in bulk — by default only HOMEs whose last activity is older than 3 days
(`--all` sweeps every age; each delete still routes through the same
stop-drain-verify path `down` uses, with liveness re-checked per name).

### Port derivation and allocation

`port = base + (cksum(name) % 199) + 1` (base `7810` → `7811..8009`), unless a
`PORT=` is pinned in `~/.kiro/crew/pods/<name>.env`. `pod up` refuses if a derived
port ever resolves to the live port.

Derivation answers "which port does this name PREFER", and it is a **default hint,
not a contract**. Every reader (`pod url`, `pod ls`, `pod exec`, Dev Fleet) calls it
to agree without coordinating, but 199 slots means two names colliding is ordinary,
and the derived port can equally be held by something that is not a pod. It does NOT
check that the port is free.

Whether the port can be had is asked once, by `pod up`, and the answer is **recorded
as a `PORT=` claim on every allocation** — so after a pod's first `up` its port comes
from that claim rather than from the formula. The formula still picks the
first-preference port for any pod that has never come up, which is why the
degradation is graceful: derivation chooses, ownership is explicit, and readers
follow the claim.

- The pod is already running → nothing is allocated, and the port is re-resolved
  under the lock. Its port is busy because it owns it, and moving a live pod would
  strand every reader.
- A hand-pinned `PORT=` that is busy → refused loudly. A deliberate pin is never
  relocated automatically. A pin outside 1–65535 is refused by name.
- Otherwise the first port that is free, not the live plane, and **not claimed by
  another pod** is taken — walking from just above the preferred slot and wrapping,
  deterministically. It is recorded as `PORT=` plus `PORT_AUTO` (which marks the
  claim as machine-made, so it stays relocatable) and a move is reported on stderr.
- Nothing available → refused loudly, naming the band and the `PORT=` escape hatch.
  A pod that cannot get a port must not appear to start.

Reading other pods' recorded claims is what makes concurrent boots safe: a unit is
`Type=simple`, so `start_pod` returns *before* the gateway binds, and until then a
bind probe reports that port free. Claiming is serialized plane-wide (`pod up` holds
a plane lock across choose → start), and the claim is written before the start, so a
colliding name sees it immediately rather than after the bind.

**A collision that still happens is detected, not mistaken for health.** Allocation
prevents the ordinary cases above, but it cannot prevent all of them: two colliding
names started concurrently can still race inside the window between the service
manager accepting the start and the gateway binding. When that happens whoever binds
first wins and the loser's gateway exits "address already in use", its unit
crash-looping behind `Restart=on-failure`. So reachability on a port is never
evidence that THIS pod is up: `health` and the credential mint both require the
process a `127.0.0.1` connect reaches to be the pod's own `MainPID` (`port_owner`),
and `pod status` / `pod ls` print `foreign (port held by another instance)` when it
is not. `pod up` names the conflict and points at `PORT=` rather than blaming the
worktree build, and pinning a colliding pod's own `PORT=` remains the manual way out.

## Configuration (`PodConfig`, all `KIROCREW_POD_*`-overridable)

| env | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KIROCREW_POD_REPO` | invoking cwd | repo git is queried from to resolve worktree names |
| `KIROCREW_POD_WORKTREES_ROOT` | (unset) | optional `name→path` fallback root (hermetic planes) |
| `KIROCREW_POD_ROOT` | `~/.kirocrew-pods` | isolated pod HOMEs (reclaimed by `pod down`) |
| `KIROCREW_POD_ENV_DIR` | `~/.kiro/crew/pods` | per-pod `CHECKOUT=`/`PORT=`/`SEED=` files |
| `KIROCREW_POD_BASE_PORT` | `7810` | port derivation base |
| `KIROCREW_POD_LIVE_PORT` | `5476` | the port a pod must never bind |
| `KIROCREW_POD_UNIT_PREFIX` | `kirocrew-pod` | systemd unit prefix |
| `KIROCREW_POD_BIN` | (auto) | the `kirocrew` binary the unit boots |

Overriding the prefix + roots + base port yields a fully **hermetic pod plane**
that can't collide with a developer's live pods — used by the test suite.

## Safety

- A pod runs its own `KIROCREW_HOME` and binds `127.0.0.1` only; it never touches
  the shared `~/.kiro/crew` data and refuses the live port.
- Every pod's `config.json` forces `enabled=false` on the tunnel and on every
  channel that carries a config-level enable (`runtime.SEED_DISABLED_SECTIONS`),
  and the booted env scrubs `SLACK_*`, `WECOM_*`, `MICROSOFT_APP_*` and non-AWS
  `*_TOKEN`, so a pod can never grab a live messaging identity — not even a
  seeded one, which is the point: `--seed ~/.kiro/crew` clones the real config.
  Pod HOME is `0700`; `config.json` is `0600`.

## Platform

Linux `systemd --user` only. On hosts without `systemctl --user` (macOS, Windows,
or a Linux box with no systemd on PATH), the verbs that touch systemd **refuse
with a single actionable line** — `pod: pods require Linux systemctl --user; this
host is darwin. Use ./dev-backend.sh to preview a worktree on this platform.` —
and exit 1. They never raise a traceback, and `pod install` writes **no** unit
file when the host can't load it.

The gate is `runtime.require_systemd()`, called from the single `systemctl()`
chokepoint plus the two siblings that shell out directly (`recent_journal` and
`_logs`, which run `journalctl`). `pod url` is pure port arithmetic and works
anywhere; `pod up` / `provision` fail earlier on their own preconditions
(worktree resolution, venv/dist) before reaching systemd.

### Session bus

`systemctl --user` locates the per-user systemd instance through
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` + `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`. A process descended from a
systemd **system** unit — which is how `kirocrew service install` runs the
gateway — inherits no login-session environment and therefore neither variable,
so pods used to fail with a bare `Failed to connect to bus: No medium found`.

`runtime._systemctl_env()` backfills both when the socket
(`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus`, else `/run/user/<uid>/bus`) actually exists; an
explicitly-set value always wins. When the socket is genuinely absent — no login
session and `Linger=no` — `require_systemd()` refuses with the fix
(`loginctl enable-linger <user>`) instead of letting systemctl emit a message
that names neither cause nor remedy. `kirocrew doctor` reports the same three
states (present / absent / present-but-no-linger).
