"""Apply a decoded session directive against the consumer's OWN session.

Called from ``dashboard/chat_runner.py``'s ``EVENT_TOOL_RESULT`` handler — the
shared turn loop for every dashboard-driven surface (dashboard, Slack mirror,
taskrunner, …) — and from ``messaging/driver.py``'s ``TurnDriver`` directive
consumer, which covers the standalone channel transports (Telegram, Discord,
standalone Slack, iMessage, Teams, Webex, WeCom, Weixin). The caller supplies
the AUTHORITATIVE ``session_key`` for the turn, so a stateless tool's directive
is applied to the exact session that produced it. Effects run IN-PROCESS via
the same cores the HTTP endpoints call (no loopback HTTP, no user-token dance):
the consumer is the authoritative session, so cross-session misattribution is
unrepresentable.

``slot`` is the dashboard chat slot when the caller has one (chat_runner) and
``None`` for a channel turn (TurnDriver). A missing slot NEVER weakens a
boundary: the dashboard-only directives are refused outright for a slot-less
caller (they act on a slot, so there is nothing to apply them to);
``set_project`` — user-surface-gated rather than dashboard-only, though its
effect targets the slot — is likewise refused when the turn
holds no slot; and the monitor trio only reads ``slot`` through fail-safe
``getattr``.

Every branch returns a human-readable confirmation string and NEVER raises into
the runner. NOTE: gateway-off (the default), the MODEL already received the
tool's OWN return over the MCP pipe; this string is recorded on KiroCrew's
transcript / WS / hook surfaces, it does NOT replace the model's tool result.
That is why the tool bodies phrase their own message to not over-claim an effect
this consumer applies (and may refuse) after the fact.

IMPORTS ARE DELIBERATELY FUNCTION-LOCAL here, except for the shared session and
Research ownership contracts plus the immutable ``AUTONUDGE_STOP_REASON``
constant. ``sel`` is a genuine cycle
(``sel`` -> config -> apps -> dashboard, and chat_runner imports this module
before it imports sel). The rest (autonudge, autonudge_authz, chat_utils,
security, chat_handlers) are deferred on purpose: they keep this module cheap to
import from the turn loop's import graph, and they resolve the symbol at CALL
time so patching the SOURCE module is what tests (and any runtime override)
actually observe — a module-scope ``from X import name`` would freeze a stale
binding and silently bypass it.

    exactly that reason. Queuing is what makes the effect reachable from inside
    the turn that wants it — the flag is consumed at a later turn boundary.

    mutable: a cron or workflow injection can rebind the live slot between the
    turn that asked for the reset and the consume that applies it, so a
    slot-resolved key would discard whatever conversation the slot points at by
    then and leave the one the caller meant untouched. The key is the caller's,
    not the slot's.

    Only the model's memory is dropped. The slot stays open, the session-map
