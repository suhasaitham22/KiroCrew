      and only a component swapped after it is refused. The leaf refuses a
      link outright (``O_NOFOLLOW``), which is ``_linked_prompt_root``'s rule.
    * With *create*, the parents are ensured BY NAME first — the module's
      contract ("callers create their own tree roots"), and the same policy as
      the read path for pre-existing links — and only the leaf is created
      through its pinned parent.

    Raises :class:`pinned_fs.PinnedPathRefusal` for a linked or non-directory
    component (callers map it to ``linked_prompt_root``), and plain ``OSError``

    - ``kiro-workspace``: ``<project>/.kiro/skills/`` (open-standard; read-only here)

    Each entry carries ``loaded_by_agents`` — the names of installed agents
    whose ``resources`` would load the skill via a ``skill://`` URI. Empty
    list means no agent loads it via the kiro-cli native loader (it may
    still be loaded via KiroCrew text-injection or an external MCP server).

    ``?agent=<name>`` scopes the listing to that agent's own ``skill://``
    mapping (matching the same globs the prompt-injection path resolves via
    :func:`agent_skill_globs`) — filtered to skills in that agent's
    ``loaded_by_agents``. An agent with no explicit skill:// resources of its
    own (``agent_skill_globs`` returns ``[]``) keeps the unfiltered, legacy
    all-or-nothing listing: an agent that never customized its skill set
    must not lose access to skills a customized agent's presence would
    otherwise imply are opt-in.

    When the agent filter is actually applied (agent given AND its globs are
    non-empty), the response is the envelope
    ``{"skills": [...], "agent_scoped": true, "agent": <name>}`` instead of
    the bare array. The flag is required wiring, not decoration: a filtered
    list — especially an EMPTY one — is byte-identical to the legacy
    unfiltered array, so without it the client cannot tell "no skills are
    mapped to this agent" apart from "no skills exist at all". Every
