"""Kiro steering files API — list / read / create / update / delete.

Steering files are plain markdown documents that Kiro injects into every
session as always-on project or personal conventions.  Two locations are in
play, and they are loaded by two different mechanisms:

* ``~/.kiro/steering/**/*.md`` — **global** (``user`` source).  kiro-cli loads
  these for every session, and the dashboard's own CC-backend injection
  (:func:`kiro_crew.context._load_steering_resources`) globs the agent
  config's ``file://.kiro/steering/**/*.md`` resource against ``$HOME``, which
  resolves to exactly this directory.
* ``<project>/.kiro/steering/**/*.md`` — **workspace** (``workspace`` source).
  kiro-cli loads these because the session subprocess runs with the slot's
  project directory as its cwd.

These endpoints back the Steering tab under Agent Capabilities, surfacing which
steering documents are in effect.

Path handling mirrors the skills browser (``handlers/_shared.py``): traversal,
absolute paths, ``~`` expansion, non-``.md`` suffixes, symlinked intermediate
directories and sensitive locations are all rejected before any read or write.
