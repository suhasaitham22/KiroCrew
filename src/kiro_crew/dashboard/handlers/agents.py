    """Re-add ``mcpServers`` entries the submitting client does not own.

    MERGE-ON-WRITE (#6664). This PUT persists a whole-file snapshot the client
    read earlier, and ``apps/bridges.py::_register_mcp_servers`` writes app MCP
    bridges into that same file under its own flock. A registration landing
    between the client's read and its PUT was therefore silently clobbered, and
    the app's tools simply stopped resolving with nothing logged anywhere.

    The rule, in one sentence: **preservation requires positive evidence of app
    or host ownership.** An on-disk entry absent from the submission is kept only
    when :func:`_app_or_host_owned` can name its owner by EXACT name; everything
    else is the client's and is deleted, which is what keeps an ordinary entry the
    user typed into this editor deletable -- including one parked under an
    installed app's namespace. If that evidence cannot be read the PUT is refused
    rather than guessed; see :func:`_app_or_host_owned`.

    The inverse test -- "keep anything no mcp.json scope declares" -- reads as
    equivalent and is not. A server added through this same editor lives ONLY in
    the installed spec, which is not a scope, so it looked unowned and was
    re-inserted on every attempt to remove it: not merely preserved against the
    user's wishes, but permanently undeletable, because each retry re-read the
    same entry. Requiring evidence costs an app bridge nothing, since a bridge is
    always positively identifiable.

    The census is NOT consulted, and the reason is worth naming because an
    earlier cut did consult it: it subtracted every scope-declared name from the
    candidates ahead of the ownership test, as precedence carried over from the
    prefix-matching era. With ownership matched by exact manifest name that
    subtraction could only ever remove a name that IS provably owned, so a user
    who also declared ``demo:notes`` in their own mcp.json made every stale PUT
    delete app ``demo``'s live bridge. Proven ownership therefore outranks a
    declaration, and a name with no proven owner is deleted whether a scope
    declares it or not -- which leaves the census unable to change any verdict.

    Two consequences worth naming rather than discovering:

    * A host-MANAGED server the rebuild RE-ADDS (``agent.emission_eligible_mcp_servers``)
      is preserved. That is not a new restriction -- the rebuild re-adds those
      entries unconditionally, so removing one through this editor never stuck.
      The qualifier is load-bearing: a managed entry the rebuild would NOT emit
      (an ``opt_in`` grant, or one whose ``spec_gate`` is shut) is deleted like
      any other absent entry, because nothing re-adds it and preserving it made
      the grant unrevocable and the gated backend resurrectable.
    * An app bridge cannot be removed through this endpoint. That is the issue's
      explicit intent; the app lifecycle (disable/uninstall, which calls
      ``_deregister_mcp_servers``) is what removes it.

    BEST-EFFORT ON AN UNREADABLE SPEC, deliberately. A corrupt installed spec has
    no parseable entries to preserve, and this editor is the user's repair path
    for exactly that state -- failing the PUT closed would leave a broken agent
    with no way to fix it from the dashboard. So an unreadable spec preserves
    nothing and the snapshot lands as it did pre-fix; enabled apps re-register
    their servers on the next gateway start
    (``reconcile_enabled_app_resources``), so the loss self-heals.

    WHAT REMAINS, now that the caller holds bridges' flock across this read and
    the spec write (see :func:`_commit_agent_config`). Every writer of this file
    INSIDE the gateway takes that same flock -- ``_register_mcp_servers``,
    ``_deregister_mcp_servers``, ``reregister_app_mcp_servers``, the agent
    rebuild, and ``handlers/mcp.py``'s spec syncs -- so no app registration or
    deregistration can interleave with this read any more, in either direction.
    The earlier writeup here claimed a bounded, self-healing residual for that
    window; that was wrong twice over, and both halves are now moot: the
    deregistration direction was never self-healing (startup reconciliation only
    re-registers ENABLED apps, so a resurrected bridge from a disabled or
    uninstalled app persisted indefinitely), and the window itself is closed
    rather than narrowed.

    The residual that is real is a writer OUTSIDE this process that does not take
    the flock -- kiro-cli writing the spec itself, or a user editing the file by
    hand. Nothing in the gateway can serialize against those, and the same
    exposure applies to every other writer here, so it is a property of the file
    rather than of this change. Torn reads are not part of it: the in-process
    writers all go through ``atomic_write``, so a reader sees the whole old file
    or the whole new one.

    Returns the names it preserved, for the caller to log.

    THE HOST ROWS ARE NOT ONE ROW, and collapsing them was a shipped defect. A
    host-managed entry is preserved *because the rebuild re-adds it*, so the
    justification only reaches the entries the rebuild actually emits. It does not
    reach an ``opt_in`` server (``kirocrew-dashboard``: never auto-emitted, and a
    refresh keeps an existing grant current without ever re-granting a removed
    one), which preservation made undeletable through the only surface that can
    revoke the grant; nor a server whose ``spec_gate`` is CLOSED
    (``kirocrew-computer`` on an unsupported platform, or with computer use off),
    which both spec writers ``pop`` — preserving it resurrects exactly the backend
    the gate exists to keep unspawned, and the next rebuild removes it again. The
    eligibility test is therefore the emitter's own
    (``agent.emission_eligible_mcp_servers``), not a second copy here.

    ABSENCE IS PROVEN BY ``lstat`` RAISING ``FileNotFoundError``, nothing weaker.
    ``Path.is_file()`` and ``Path.is_dir()`` answer False for a malformed path as
    readily as for a missing one, so screening on them alone read a broken
    symlink, a directory-where-a-file-belongs, or an unstattable path as "not
    installed" and made that app's live bridges deletable. Every present-but-wrong
    shape raises instead -- see :func:`_require_present_shape`, which screens the
    shape at the CALL SITE so ``manager.app_enabled_state`` keeps the contract its
    other callers rely on. The ENUMERATION obeys the same rule: each child of the
    apps root is stat'ed explicitly rather than filtered through ``is_dir()``,
    because pathlib routes that fault through ``_ignore_error`` and hands back a
    plain False for ENOENT, ENOTDIR, EBADF and ELOOP alike -- so a child that is a
    symlink loop looked like a regular file and was skipped, deleting the bridges
    of the app under that name. Only a resolved stat may exclude a child, and only
    by proving it is not a directory.

    Four justifications carry the rows that are not self-evident:

    * A SCOPE DECLARATION DOES NOT OUTRANK PROVEN OWNERSHIP. An earlier cut
      subtracted every scope-declared name from the candidates ahead of this test,
      as precedence carried over from the prefix-matching era. Against EXACT
      manifest names that subtraction could only ever remove a name that IS
      provably owned: a user who also declares ``demo:notes`` in their own mcp.json
      made every stale PUT delete app ``demo``'s live bridge. A declared name with
      no proven owner is deleted anyway, by the general rule, so the census cannot
      change a verdict and is not consulted.

    * DISABLED ⇒ DELETE. The disable lifecycle owns bridge removal
      (``_deregister_mcp_servers``), and a deregistration that FAILED during
      disable leaves a stale entry behind. Startup reconciliation only
      re-registers ENABLED apps, so it never revisits that entry: preserving it
      would keep a disabled app's code launchable through the retained bridge
      forever. Ownership therefore requires installed AND enabled.
    * ABSENT ``enabled`` FIELD ⇒ ENABLED. This matches ``apps.manager``'s own
      parse exactly -- ``InstalledApp.from_dict`` reads
      ``bool(data.get("enabled", True))`` (manager.py:170) over a dataclass whose
      default is ``enabled: bool = True`` (manager.py:114). A legacy record
      written before the field existed is treated as enabled everywhere else in
      the tree, and disagreeing here would delete the live bridges of an app the
      rest of the system considers running.
    * UNREADABLE ⇒ FAIL LOUD, never a guess. Preserving on an unreadable source
      strands undeletable entries; deleting clobbers live bridges over a fault
      that may be transient. The refusal is raised before any durable write.

    Enablement comes from :func:`manager.app_enabled_state`, whose tri-state is
    written for exactly this caller: its own docstring separates "not installed"
    and "unreadable" *because* collapsing them is "the wrong [answer] for a
    caller deciding whether to DELETE its files". ``True``/``False`` are definite
    answers and ``None`` means the metadata could not be read. ``is_app_enabled``
    and ``list_apps`` are both unusable here -- each collapses an unreadable
    record into a plain "no", which silently narrows ownership and deletes that
    app's bridges.

    POSITIVE identification by EXACT NAME, and both halves of that matter. The
    inverse test -- "preserve anything no mcp.json scope declares" -- made a
    server the user typed into the raw editor permanently undeletable, because it
    lives only in the installed spec and the spec is not a scope. A prefix test
    over installed app ids reproduced the same defect for any name the client
    parked under an app's namespace. Only an exact name an owner actually claims
    is evidence.

    Two sources, both narrow:

    * HOST-managed, and only the entries a rebuild would actually RE-ADD:
      ``agent.emission_eligible_mcp_servers()`` — the always-emitted managed
      servers (cron/core) plus the edition's ``_extra_mcp_servers``. Preserving
      one is justified BY that re-add, so the set has to be the emitter's, which
      is why it is imported rather than recomputed here. The two managed entries
      a rebuild does NOT re-add are excluded and stay deletable: an ``opt_in``
      grant (``kirocrew-dashboard``) that no rebuild re-introduces, and a
      server whose ``spec_gate`` is shut (``kirocrew-computer``), which both spec
      writers actively ``pop``. Preserving those made a revocation impossible
      through the only surface that can revoke it, and resurrected a backend the
      gate exists to keep unspawned.
    * APP-declared: the exact ``<app>:<server>`` set from installed manifests --
      see :func:`_app_declared_server_names`.

    ON A FAILED READ THIS RAISES rather than guessing, because both guesses are
    wrong and each one is a defect this span has already shipped. Preserving
    every namespaced entry makes entries permanently undeletable; treating the
    declared set as empty deletes live app bridges over a fault that may be
    transient -- the very clobber #6664 exists to fix. The PUT turns the raise
    into a 500 the client can retry, and because this runs at step (0a) before
    any durable write, all three targets stay byte-identical.

    That branch IS reachable: manifests are separate files under the apps
    directory, not covered by the installed-spec flock this unit holds, so a
    corrupt ``app.json`` or an unreadable apps directory reaches it and persists
    until repaired. It is reached whenever ANY candidate is namespaced, host-owned
    or not: the refusal is per-PUT rather than per-entry, so an edition extra
    whose name contains ``:`` is refused alongside a genuinely app-shaped one. That
    is the fail-loud direction and it is retryable, so it stays as it is.

    """Perform the one fallible read and EVERY durable write of one PUT, as one unit.

    This function is the commit half of the invariant stated at the
    :func:`api_agent_config` PUT branch: it is the ONLY place that branch
    persists application state, it is purely synchronous, and it is dispatched
    exactly once through the shielded ``_offload_config_write``. Those three
    properties make a PUT **non-cancellable but not rollback-atomic**:

    * Purely synchronous — there is no await between two writes, so no
      cancellation and no other task can be interleaved into the sequence. A
      worker thread cannot be cancelled at all, so once this starts it runs to
      completion.
    * Dispatched once, shielded — the caller cannot unwind (and so cannot
      release the transaction lock) until this has returned. The alternative
      shape, awaiting each write separately under the lock, puts a cancellation
      point between writes however wide the lock is.
    * The only writer — nothing durable happens before the call, so every
      failure earlier in the handler leaves the three targets byte-identical.

    What that does NOT buy is rollback: an I/O failure (permission, quota, disk
    full, lock-open, a failed atomic rename) stops the sequence where it is, and
    the writes already committed stay committed. The honest failure prefixes, in
    order, are:

    0. the governance filter raises — nothing durable, and the caller's 500 is
       exact (it fails closed, so a raise withholds rather than grants). The
       merge-on-write step ahead of it (0a) adds one prefix of its own, and it is
       the harmless end: it can raise :class:`AppOwnershipUnreadable` while
       having mutated only the in-memory *config*, so the caller's 500 is exact
       and all three targets are byte-identical (see
       :func:`_app_or_host_owned` for why refusing beats guessing);
    1. the ``config.json`` read raises :class:`ConfigReadError` — nothing
       durable, and the caller's 500 is exact;
    2. the ``config.json`` write fails — nothing durable;
    3. the first bookkeeping write fails — ``config.json`` updated;
    4. the second bookkeeping write fails (the lift can write twice, once per
       key) — ``config.json`` updated plus one bookkeeping key;
    5. the installed-spec write fails — ``config.json`` and bookkeeping
       updated, the spec unchanged.

    Order inside the unit is chosen to make the *earliest* prefixes the *least*
    harmful, and four steps are load-bearing rather than incidental:

    * The merge (0a) precedes the governance filter, so the entries it re-adds
      are governed like any other — see step (0a). It is in the unit at all for
      the same reason as the read at (1): its on-disk read must be adjacent to
      the write it feeds, or an app registration landing during the flock wait
      is clobbered exactly as it was pre-fix.
    * The governance filter is FIRST among the steps that decide what is
      persisted, and it is in here at all so that the grant decision cannot be
      made against a ceiling that changes before the write publishes it — see
      step (0). Ahead of every write because it persists nothing, so its own
      fail-closed raise costs no partial write.
    * The read is FIRST among the writes' own inputs. It is the only
      fallible-by-decision I/O step, and running it here — immediately adjacent
      to the write it feeds — is what closes the lost-update window: on the
      previous shape the caller read the baseline and the worker wrote it back
      one executor hop later, so a concurrent writer landing in that gap had its
      unrelated fields silently reverted.
    * The bookkeeping lift runs AFTER the ``config.json`` write (so prefix 2
      leaves the sidecar untouched, restoring the pre-lock ordering) but BEFORE
      the spec write, because it STRIPS Kiro Crew keys (``model_managed`` /
      ``cc_model``) out of the same *config* dict the spec write then persists —
      reverse the two and the spec lands with fields kiro-cli's
      ``deny_unknown_fields`` rejects (#2570).

    Everything else fallible has already been decided by the caller: *config* is
    parsed and validated, *removed_per_key* is the computed ``removedTools`` map,
    and both paths are resolved.

    Returns whatever the bookkeeping lift returns (True when it stripped a
    key), so the caller can log it after the lock is released — logging is not
    durable state and has no business inside the unit.

            #    (messaging channel savers, security, the MCP handlers, agent
            #    create/update/delete). This PUT's own RMW now spans an executor
            #    hop, so the event loop no longer serializes it for free: without
            #    this lock a sibling RMW can read the same baseline and the last
            #    atomic rename silently reverts the other side's unrelated
            #    settings. Held ACROSS the offload for exactly the reason
            #    api_mcp_gateway_set_stub holds it across its own offload.
            # 3. ``bridges._mcp_lock(target=installed_path)``
            #    (~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.lock) is the FILE lock. The transaction
            #    lock does not cover it: apps/bridges.py does whole-file
            #    read-modify-writes of THIS SAME file under that separate flock
            #    (app enable/disable, MCP (de)registration). Holding only the
            #    transaction lock leaves a concurrent app enable and this PUT
            #    each writing the whole file, and the last atomic rename silently
            #    discards the other side's changes.
            #
            # Order is transaction → config → file and must stay that way. Each
            # edge already exists in the tree and none is inverted anywhere:
            # transaction→config at api_mcp_toggle / api_mcp_toggle_all /
            # api_mcp_remove in handlers/mcp.py, config→file wherever
            # ``_sync_mcp_to_agent`` runs under the config lock (api_mcp_remove,
            # api_mcp_server_detail, mcp_discover, api_capability_mcp_install),
            # and no config-lock or file-lock holder in the tree acquires the
            # transaction lock inside, so there is no ABBA cycle. The file lock is
            # taken inside the worker thread (by ``_commit_agent_config``, which
            # holds it across the whole unit so merge-on-write's on-disk READ and
            # the spec write cannot be split by an app writer) — a blocking flock
            # on the event loop would freeze the gateway while app registration
            # holds it. Widening that innermost hold changes no ORDER: the outer
            # two are already held before the unit is dispatched.
            # Nothing else in this branch takes a cross-process lock: governance +
            # SEL and agent_state take none, so running the filter inside the
            # worker adds no lock edge to the transaction → config → file order.

    offering (and kept SHOWING as selected) a model no turn can run. The

    static catalog of everything KiroCrew knows how to name, so a free-tier user
    used to be offered the full flagship list and only discovered the truth when a
    prompt failed.

    So when anything is advertised, registry rows are FILTERED DOWN to it (keeping
    the registry's cleaner display names for the survivors), and advertised models
    the registry does not list are appended for forward-compat.

    When NOTHING is advertised the registry is shown unfiltered. That is not a
    fallback to the old behaviour by preference -- an empty advertised set means
    "no session has initialized yet", which is indistinguishable from "this account
    gets nothing", and showing an empty picker on a cold dashboard would be worse
