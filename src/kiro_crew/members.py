"""Per-crew-member space: ``$KIROCREW_HOME/members/<slug>/``.

A crew member is the same agent running with different context, so its space
holds what belongs to that member alone rather than to the user as a whole. The
first occupant is ``activity.jsonl`` — pointers to the sessions the member took
part in, which is the signal trigger generation reads.

The directory name is a **slug**: stable, immutable, and path-safe. A member's
display name is editable independently, so a rename never has to move files.
This mirrors the artifact store's ``artifacts/<slug>/`` layout, and reuses its
:func:`~kiro_crew.artifacts.slugify` so both surfaces normalize names the same
way.

Activity entries are pointers by design: they carry the session key, not a copy
of what happened. Details are read back from the session itself, so the log
cannot drift from the transcript — and it survives session pruning, which is why
frequency counts taken from it stay stable.
