"""Auto-nudge service — reactive same-session self-prompting loop.

Each active loop is bound to a dashboard chat slot. When the slot's turn
completes (``HOOK_EVENT_STOP``), we arm a timer toward the loop's persistent
deadline (``next_due_ts``). If the deadline elapses with no new user input,
we inject the configured nudge message as the next turn into the same slot.

The countdown is DEADLINE-PRESERVING: a user message cancels the pending fire
(a nudge must never race a human turn) but does not push the deadline back —
when the user's turn ends, the timer resumes toward the same ``next_due_ts``,
firing shortly after the turn if the deadline already passed. Only the loop's
own delivered cycles start a fresh full interval (measured from the nudge
turn's end). Without this, a session chatted in more often than ``idle_secs``
starves its loop forever: every message restarted the full interval, so a
30-minute babysit loop in an active conversation never fired at all.

State is persisted to ``~/.kiro/crew/autonudge.json`` (fcntl-locked, atomic
write). On gateway restart, active loops are reloaded and timers re-armed.

The browser observes the loop through the normal chat stream path — nudges
appear as user-style messages tagged ``[auto-nudge cycle N]`` so they are
visually distinct from human input.

Feature-flagged via env ``KIROCREW_AUTONUDGE`` (on by default; set to ``0`` to disable).

# Namespaced session-key prefixes that identify messaging-channel sessions
# (as opposed to bare dashboard chat-slot keys). Channel-bound loops have no
# dashboard turn-lifecycle hooks (notify_turn_complete / notify_user_input),
# so they run on a fixed interval instead of an idle timer: the timer re-arms
# itself right after every delivered fire.
#
# This mirrors ``messaging.link.CHANNEL_SESSION_NAMESPACES``, spelled out here
# rather than derived from it, for two independent reasons:
#
# 1. IMPORT WEIGHT. ``autonudge`` is imported at module scope by ``mcp_core``
#    (i.e. by every MCP server process) and by the dashboard chat layer, and it
#    depends only on config/security/platform_compat today. Naming
#    ``kiro_crew.messaging.link`` runs ``messaging/__init__``, which pulls the
#    driver/renderer/transport layer and, transitively, the ACP client, agent,
#    hooks, artifacts, metrics and sqlite — measured at 48 additional
#    ``kiro_crew`` modules to obtain one tuple of string literals.
# 2. THIS IS A KEY-SHAPE QUESTION, NOT A LIVE-CAPABILITY ONE. ``is_channel_key``
#    selects the RE-ARM STRATEGY and the expiry-notification metadata, so it has
#    to answer identically whether or not the transport happens to be registered
#    at this instant. Deriving it from a runtime ``supports_proactive_send``
#    lookup fails toward the WRONG branch: a loop whose transport is momentarily
#    absent would read as a dashboard slot, so ``_run_fire_cycle`` would stop
#    self-re-arming it — and nothing else ever will, since
#    ``notify_turn_complete`` never fires for a channel key — while the expiry
#    notice would synthesize a ``dashboard:<namespace>:<id>`` jump link pointing
#    at no slot.
#
# Membership therefore does NOT assert deliverability; it asserts "this key names
# a conversation rather than a chat slot". Whether a nudge can actually be
# delivered stays with the fail-closed ladder in ``dashboard/chat_runner.py``
# (``_resolve_channel_target``: governance, then a REGISTERED transport, then
# ``supports_proactive_send``), which logs its reason and degrades to a no-op.
# So a namespace is listed even when nothing can currently be delivered to it,
# and the two clearest cases are both here: ``whatsapp`` has no transport package
# in this fork at all, and ``feishu`` ships one that declares
# ``supports_proactive_send=False`` (its renderer only replies to an inbound
# message id, so a nudge cycle has nowhere to put the answer). Both still classify
# as channel keys, because the alternative is worse than a refusal: an unlisted key
# is read as a dashboard slot and silently stops being re-armed, whereas a listed
# one reaches the ladder and is refused with a logged reason. Being listed is
# likewise not an arming permission — that is ``binding_key_for``, which is
# narrower still and gated on an ownership check and a fire route.

    """Re-home a persisted ``stop_sentinel_path`` onto the CURRENT data home.

    The kill-switch path is resolved once at arm time (``resolve_stop_sentinel``,
    which builds it under ``workspace_dir_for(...)`` → normally
    ``config_dir()/workspace``) and then persisted verbatim in the loop store.
    That store survives the one-time ``~/.kirocrew`` → ``~/.kiro/crew`` data-home
    migration (``config/paths.py``) and is re-armed on the next ``start()``, so a
    loop armed BEFORE the move comes back pointing at a directory that no longer
    exists. ``_timer`` only ever tests ``Path(stop_sentinel_path).exists()``, so
    such a loop has a DEAD kill switch: a sentinel written at the freshly
    resolved (current-home) path is never seen, and the only remaining stops are
    ``max_cycles`` and an explicit remove.

    Three transformations, in order:

    1. **Pass through a path already under the CURRENT home.** Checked FIRST,
       because ``KIROCREW_HOME`` may legally point *inside* the legacy root
       (e.g. ``~/.kirocrew/dev``). Such a path is lexically under
       ``~/.kirocrew`` yet already live and correct; re-homing it would produce
       ``~/.kirocrew/dev/dev/workspace/…``, persist that, and — since the
       rewrite is not idempotent — append another segment every boot, disabling
       a WORKING kill switch with the very code meant to repair dead ones.
    2. **Re-home a STRANDED legacy-rooted path.** A path under ``~/.kirocrew``
       is rewritten onto the resolved current home. The migration relocated the
       whole tree wholesale, so the tail after the home prefix is still correct.
       Gated on the sentinel's directory no longer existing: an absolute
       ``workspaces.<name>.dir`` may legitimately live inside that tree (and the
       legacy root can survive as debris), and rewriting a live path would move
       a working kill switch outside its configured workspace and persist that.
       Skipped when the current home IS the legacy home (``KIROCREW_HOME``
       pointing there, or the migration's fall-back-to-legacy path) — there the
       persisted path is already live. Both sides are normalized LEXICALLY
       (``os.path.normpath``, no filesystem access) before the containment
       test, so an unnormalized value like ``~/.kirocrew/../workspace/STOP``
       is not mistaken for a legacy-contained path and rewritten elsewhere.
    3. **Re-apply the arm-time sensitivity refusal.** ``authorize_and_add_nudge``
       refuses a sensitive ``stop_sentinel_path`` at arm time, but the denylist
       can widen between releases and the persisted value outlives the original
       check. A path that is sensitive NOW is dropped to ``""`` (no sentinel)
       rather than kept, so the service never stats an attacker- or
       credential-adjacent location on a timer. The check itself FAILS CLOSED:
       if ``is_sensitive_path`` raises, the path is dropped rather than trusted,
       because an unvalidated path is exactly what this step exists to reject.

    Returns the (possibly rewritten) path, or ``""`` to mean "no sentinel".
    Non-``str`` input (a malformed store where ``stop_sentinel_path`` is a
    number or list) yields ``""`` instead of raising — this runs inside
    ``_load()`` during ``start()``, so an exception here would abort gateway
    startup entirely.

    Deliberately does NOT require the path to live under the data home: an
    absolute ``workspaces.<name>.dir`` is a legitimate configuration, and
    clearing those would break working kill switches.

    BLOCKING: performs no filesystem I/O itself, but ``is_sensitive_path``
    resolves realpaths, which can block on an unavailable network mount.
    ``start()`` therefore runs the whole load+repair phase in an executor.

        a just-delivered fire, a legacy store entry) starts a fresh full
        countdown from now, and the assignment is persisted through a
        supervised background write so a restart resumes this countdown
        rather than restarting the interval. A deadline still in the future
        resumes with exactly the remaining time; only one already in the past
        fires after a short beat (``_OVERDUE_REARM_SECS``) rather than
        instantly, so a user mid-conversation keeps deferring it simply by
        sending another message. The delay is capped at ``idle_secs`` so a
        clock jump can never park the timer beyond one full interval.

        A monitor loop arms through this same path and on the same deadline. Its
        cadence is the interval the user already set, not a second clock on the

        for a monitor is not WHEN the timer wakes but what the wake costs -- the
        probe gate in :meth:`_timer` decides whether that tick spends a turn.

        ONE monitor is refused a timer outright: a record whose ``version`` this
        gateway does not implement. Such a record belongs to a newer gateway
        (a downgrade or a rollback read its store), and this controller cannot
        interpret its policy -- so arming it would run the loop under a policy
        nobody here understands, which for the pre-gate code path means
        injecting the raw message every interval with no decision at all. The
        refusal is deliberately made HERE, on the arm, rather than by rewriting
        the record: the stored ``active`` intent belongs to the gateway that
