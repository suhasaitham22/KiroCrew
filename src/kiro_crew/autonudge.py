"""Auto-nudge service — reactive same-session self-prompting loop.

Each active loop is bound to a dashboard chat slot. When the slot's turn
completes (``HOOK_EVENT_STOP``), we arm a timer toward the loop's persistent
deadline (``next_due_ts``). If the deadline elapses with no new user input,
we inject the configured nudge message as the next turn into the same slot.

The countdown is DEADLINE-PRESERVING: a user message cancels the pending fire
(a nudge must never race a human turn) but does not push the deadline back —
when the user's turn ends, the timer resumes toward the same ``next_due_ts``,
firing shortly after the turn if the deadline already passed. Only the loop's
own delivered cycles start a fresh full interval (measured from the nudge
turn's end). Without this, a session chatted in more often than ``idle_secs``
starves its loop forever: every message restarted the full interval, so a
30-minute babysit loop in an active conversation never fired at all.

State is persisted to ``~/.kiro/crew/autonudge.json`` (fcntl-locked, atomic
write). On gateway restart, active loops are reloaded and timers re-armed.

The browser observes the loop through the normal chat stream path — nudges
appear as user-style messages tagged ``[auto-nudge cycle N]`` so they are
visually distinct from human input.

Feature-flagged via env ``KIROCREW_AUTONUDGE`` (on by default; set to ``0`` to disable).

# Namespaced session-key prefixes that identify messaging-channel sessions
# (as opposed to bare dashboard chat-slot keys). Channel-bound loops have no
# dashboard turn-lifecycle hooks (notify_turn_complete / notify_user_input),
# so they run on a fixed interval instead of an idle timer: the timer re-arms
# itself right after every delivered fire.
#
# This mirrors ``messaging.link.CHANNEL_SESSION_NAMESPACES``, spelled out here
# rather than derived from it, for two independent reasons:
#
# 1. IMPORT WEIGHT. ``autonudge`` is imported at module scope by ``mcp_core``
#    (i.e. by every MCP server process) and by the dashboard chat layer, and it
#    depends only on config/security/platform_compat today. Naming
#    ``kiro_crew.messaging.link`` runs ``messaging/__init__``, which pulls the
#    driver/renderer/transport layer and, transitively, the ACP client, agent,
#    hooks, artifacts, metrics and sqlite — measured at 48 additional
#    ``kiro_crew`` modules to obtain one tuple of string literals.
# 2. THIS IS A KEY-SHAPE QUESTION, NOT A LIVE-CAPABILITY ONE. ``is_channel_key``
#    selects the RE-ARM STRATEGY and the expiry-notification metadata, so it has
#    to answer identically whether or not the transport happens to be registered
#    at this instant. Deriving it from a runtime ``supports_proactive_send``
#    lookup fails toward the WRONG branch: a loop whose transport is momentarily
#    absent would read as a dashboard slot, so ``_run_fire_cycle`` would stop
#    self-re-arming it — and nothing else ever will, since
#    ``notify_turn_complete`` never fires for a channel key — while the expiry
#    notice would synthesize a ``dashboard:<namespace>:<id>`` jump link pointing
#    at no slot.
#
# Membership therefore does NOT assert deliverability; it asserts "this key names
# a conversation rather than a chat slot". Whether a nudge can actually be
# delivered stays with the fail-closed ladder in ``dashboard/chat_runner.py``
# (``_resolve_channel_target``: governance, then a REGISTERED transport, then
# ``supports_proactive_send``), which logs its reason and degrades to a no-op.
# So a namespace is listed even when nothing can currently be delivered to it,
# and the two clearest cases are both here: ``whatsapp`` has no transport package
# in this fork at all, and ``feishu`` ships one that declares
# ``supports_proactive_send=False`` (its renderer only replies to an inbound
# message id, so a nudge cycle has nowhere to put the answer). Both still classify
# as channel keys, because the alternative is worse than a refusal: an unlisted key
# is read as a dashboard slot and silently stops being re-armed, whereas a listed
# one reaches the ladder and is refused with a logged reason. Being listed is
# likewise not an arming permission — that is ``binding_key_for``, which is
# narrower still and gated on an ownership check and a fire route.

    """Re-home a persisted ``stop_sentinel_path`` onto the CURRENT data home.

    The kill-switch path is resolved once at arm time (``resolve_stop_sentinel``,
    which builds it under ``workspace_dir_for(...)`` → normally
    ``config_dir()/workspace``) and then persisted verbatim in the loop store.
    That store survives the one-time ``~/.kirocrew`` → ``~/.kiro/crew`` data-home
    migration (``config/paths.py``) and is re-armed on the next ``start()``, so a
    loop armed BEFORE the move comes back pointing at a directory that no longer
    exists. ``_timer`` only ever tests ``Path(stop_sentinel_path).exists()``, so
    such a loop has a DEAD kill switch: a sentinel written at the freshly
    resolved (current-home) path is never seen, and the only remaining stops are
    ``max_cycles`` and an explicit remove.

    Three transformations, in order:

    1. **Pass through a path already under the CURRENT home.** Checked FIRST,
       because ``KIROCREW_HOME`` may legally point *inside* the legacy root
       (e.g. ``~/.kirocrew/dev``). Such a path is lexically under
       ``~/.kirocrew`` yet already live and correct; re-homing it would produce
       ``~/.kirocrew/dev/dev/workspace/…``, persist that, and — since the
       rewrite is not idempotent — append another segment every boot, disabling
       a WORKING kill switch with the very code meant to repair dead ones.
    2. **Re-home a STRANDED legacy-rooted path.** A path under ``~/.kirocrew``
       is rewritten onto the resolved current home. The migration relocated the
       whole tree wholesale, so the tail after the home prefix is still correct.
       Gated on the sentinel's directory no longer existing: an absolute
       ``workspaces.<name>.dir`` may legitimately live inside that tree (and the
       legacy root can survive as debris), and rewriting a live path would move
       a working kill switch outside its configured workspace and persist that.
       Skipped when the current home IS the legacy home (``KIROCREW_HOME``
       pointing there, or the migration's fall-back-to-legacy path) — there the
       persisted path is already live. Both sides are normalized LEXICALLY
       (``os.path.normpath``, no filesystem access) before the containment
       test, so an unnormalized value like ``~/.kirocrew/../workspace/STOP``
       is not mistaken for a legacy-contained path and rewritten elsewhere.
    3. **Re-apply the arm-time sensitivity refusal.** ``authorize_and_add_nudge``
       refuses a sensitive ``stop_sentinel_path`` at arm time, but the denylist
       can widen between releases and the persisted value outlives the original
       check. A path that is sensitive NOW is dropped to ``""`` (no sentinel)
       rather than kept, so the service never stats an attacker- or
       credential-adjacent location on a timer. The check itself FAILS CLOSED:
       if ``is_sensitive_path`` raises, the path is dropped rather than trusted,
       because an unvalidated path is exactly what this step exists to reject.

    Returns the (possibly rewritten) path, or ``""`` to mean "no sentinel".
    Non-``str`` input (a malformed store where ``stop_sentinel_path`` is a
    number or list) yields ``""`` instead of raising — this runs inside
    ``_load()`` during ``start()``, so an exception here would abort gateway
    startup entirely.

    Deliberately does NOT require the path to live under the data home: an
    absolute ``workspaces.<name>.dir`` is a legitimate configuration, and
    clearing those would break working kill switches.

    BLOCKING: performs no filesystem I/O itself, but ``is_sensitive_path``
    resolves realpaths, which can block on an unavailable network mount.
    ``start()`` therefore runs the whole load+repair phase in an executor.

        untouched, so the schedule itself survives — ``notify_turn_complete``
        resumes the same countdown rather than restarting the full interval.

        While the loop is mid-fire this must NOT cancel the timer: that task may
        be parked on ``_persist_locked()`` writing the delivered cycle, and
        cancelling it there abandons an in-flight executor write whose stale
        payload can later overwrite a newer update/delete (state resurrected
        after a restart). User priority is still honoured — the deferred re-arm
        is dropped, so no further nudge is scheduled from this cycle.

        Two conditions make a cancel wrong rather than merely redundant, and both are

        * **The currently running timer task** (a self-re-arm from inside ``_timer``) is
          about to return on its own, and cancelling it would inject a spurious
          ``CancelledError`` into the finishing task.
        * **A task whose event loop has already closed.** ``Task.cancel`` schedules the
          cancellation through ``loop.call_soon``, which raises ``RuntimeError: Event loop
          is closed`` — so this raises out of ``remove``/``remove_sync`` and the dashboard
          handler above it answers 500. The service is a process-global singleton, so its
          ``_timers`` outlive the loop that created them whenever one loop is replaced by
          another: the gateway's own shutdown, and every test that drives a handler after
          an earlier test's loop closed. Asked positively (``get_loop().is_closed()``)
          rather than by catching the ``RuntimeError``, because a closed loop is the one
          state where cancelling is a NO-OP by definition — the task can never run again —
          and catching would also swallow a genuine scheduling fault.

        The closed-loop question is asked FIRST because it needs no running loop of its
        own, and ``stop()`` reaches here from synchronous callers (gateway shutdown, test
        teardown) where ``asyncio.current_task()`` would raise instead of answering — hence
