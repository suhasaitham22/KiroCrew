"""Job SDK — app-scoped durable runs for long, user-initiated foreground work.

``CronSDK`` schedules work for later; this owns work a human started and is
watching NOW. The gap it closes is that the product had no server-side
representation of "a task of mine is running": the fact lived only in the React
component that started it, so navigating away destroyed the fact while the work
kept going, and the UI then reported the task as stopped. See
``docs/system-specs/features/app-sdk-durable-jobs-and-view-state.md``.

Five design points are load-bearing rather than incidental.

**P1 records that a run EXISTS and how it ended — nothing it produced.** There
is no ``params`` a caller passes in, and no ``progress`` or ``result`` a runner
reports out. A run's record holds its identity, its lifecycle and, if it failed,
one error string. That is deliberate and is the whole of what the originating
problem needs: the UI's question is "is my task still running", not "how far
along is it". The payload channels are structured data that must be sanitized
before it can be written or served, and P1 has NO consumer that reads them, so
they were carrying that cost for capability nobody calls. They return in P2,
designed against a real consumer, as types that are sanitized by construction
rather than by a rule each writer has to remember.

**A runner is REGISTERED, not passed per call.** ``register(kind, fn)`` binds a
kind to the callable that services it, once, at app init. ``start(kind, ...)``
then names the kind only. This is what lets a caller that cannot hold a Python
callable — the browser, and the startup reconciliation pass — address a run.

**Cancellation is cooperative and DECLARED.** A worker thread cannot be killed,
so ``cancel()`` can only ask. The SDK cannot inspect an arbitrary ``fn`` to find
out whether it ever checks, so cancellability is the app's assertion at
``register(..., cancellable=True)`` and defaults to False. A run recorded
``cancellable: false`` answers ``cancel()`` with ``False`` rather than
pretending, and the UI hides the control instead of offering a button that does
nothing.

**One writer per run file.** There is no lock helper beside ``atomic_write`` and
concurrent read-modify-write of one document is last-writer-wins, so each run is
its own file and writers never share a path: ``start`` writes the initial record
BEFORE handing off, the worker thread is the sole writer from then on, and
``cancel`` writes nothing at all (it sets an in-memory event; the worker records
the outcome at its next checkpoint). Reconciliation writes only records from a
process that is already gone. A requested cancel still has to be visible to a
reader before that checkpoint arrives, so it is DERIVED on read from the live
table -- ``cancelling_ids`` -- rather than written down. Reading it costs nothing
the rule protects; writing it would cost the rule.

**Claiming a run and LAUNCHING it are separate, and the interval between them is
named.** That interval contains a disk write, so it is not instantaneous, and the
run is already in the live table while its thread does not yet exist. Three
defects came from code that had no name for that state: cleanup joined a thread
that was never started, which raised and escaped the disable so the records were
never deleted; a start that had already claimed launched into an app being
disabled; and the record said ``running`` while no worker existed. So the record
starts at ``STARTING`` and the worker itself completes the transition to
``RUNNING``, the live entry carries ``started`` as the one authority on whether
there is a thread to join, and the launch is a GUARDED transition performed under
the same lock cleanup marks with -- not an unconditional call. Each of the three
questions is now answered by reading state rather than by assuming it.

That discipline settles writer-vs-WRITER, not reader-vs-writer: a reader still
races the one writer's temp-file-plus-rename. POSIX hides this because rename is
atomic for a reader, so the reads go through ``atomic_write``'s
``read_bytes_with_retry`` -- on Windows the same instant raises
``PermissionError`` at the reader, and a record read is not optional here
(``get`` answers the HTTP surface, and ``iter_runs`` feeds reconciliation).

Staleness is decided by ``_ORIGIN``, a token minted once per gateway process —
not by pid, which can be reused by the very process doing the reconciling.

That token is the GATEWAY process, which also bounds what this SDK describes: an
app whose work executes in another process is outside it. An app declaring
``backend.entryPoint`` is spawned as its own OS process (``apps/backend.py``,
``start_app_backend``), and ``register`` binds a kind to a callable held here in
the gateway, so such an app has no registration path. It is also not merely
unsupported: on a restart that ``_reap_stale_app_backends`` leaves the backend
alive through, ``reconcile`` marks that still-running work ``INTERRUPTED``, a
terminal state no later pass revisits.

        Call from the app's ``on_startup`` hook. ``cancellable=True`` is the
        app's assertion that ``fn`` polls ``handle.cancelled`` at checkpoints;
        the SDK cannot verify it, so the consumer's migration checklist has to
        name those checkpoints.

        A CALLABLE WHOSE INVOCATION DOES NOT RUN ITS BODY IS REFUSED HERE, at
        registration, rather than failing at run time. ``_execute`` calls
        ``fn(handle)`` on a worker thread and discards the return value by design,
        and three shapes return a lazy object instead of doing the work: a
        coroutine function, an async generator function, and a plain generator
        function. For each, the object is dropped, no line of the runner's body
        ever runs, and the record is written ``done``. That is the worst available
        outcome -- a run that reports success having executed nothing -- and it is
        silent, since an un-awaited coroutine warning goes to the gateway log at
        most. The check goes through ``__call__`` as well as the object itself, so
        a callable instance with an ``async def __call__`` is caught too.

        Refusing is deliberately not the same as supporting: driving a coroutine
        correctly means deciding which loop owns it, how cancellation crosses
        the thread boundary, and what a blocking runner does to that loop, and
        those are design questions this refusal does not answer. It answers only

        (``interrupt_cause``). They are independent because they describe
        different times -- past progress, present capability -- and a consumer
        acts on them separately: a run interrupted from ``running`` may have
        committed side effects, one interrupted from ``queued`` or ``starting``
