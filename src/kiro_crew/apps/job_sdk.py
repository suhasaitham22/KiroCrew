"""Job SDK — app-scoped durable runs for long, user-initiated foreground work.

``CronSDK`` schedules work for later; this owns work a human started and is
watching NOW. The gap it closes is that the product had no server-side
representation of "a task of mine is running": the fact lived only in the React
component that started it, so navigating away destroyed the fact while the work
kept going, and the UI then reported the task as stopped. See
``docs/system-specs/features/app-sdk-durable-jobs-and-view-state.md``.

Five design points are load-bearing rather than incidental.

**P1 records that a run EXISTS and how it ended — nothing it produced.** There
is no ``params`` a caller passes in, and no ``progress`` or ``result`` a runner
reports out. A run's record holds its identity, its lifecycle and, if it failed,
one error string. That is deliberate and is the whole of what the originating
problem needs: the UI's question is "is my task still running", not "how far
along is it". The payload channels are structured data that must be sanitized
before it can be written or served, and P1 has NO consumer that reads them, so
they were carrying that cost for capability nobody calls. They return in P2,
designed against a real consumer, as types that are sanitized by construction
rather than by a rule each writer has to remember.

**A runner is REGISTERED, not passed per call.** ``register(kind, fn)`` binds a
kind to the callable that services it, once, at app init. ``start(kind, ...)``
then names the kind only. This is what lets a caller that cannot hold a Python
callable — the browser, and the startup reconciliation pass — address a run.

**Cancellation is cooperative and DECLARED.** A worker thread cannot be killed,
so ``cancel()`` can only ask. The SDK cannot inspect an arbitrary ``fn`` to find
out whether it ever checks, so cancellability is the app's assertion at
``register(..., cancellable=True)`` and defaults to False. A run recorded
``cancellable: false`` answers ``cancel()`` with ``False`` rather than
pretending, and the UI hides the control instead of offering a button that does
nothing.

**One writer per run file.** There is no lock helper beside ``atomic_write`` and
concurrent read-modify-write of one document is last-writer-wins, so each run is
its own file and writers never share a path: ``start`` writes the initial record
BEFORE handing off, the worker thread is the sole writer from then on, and
``cancel`` writes nothing at all (it sets an in-memory event; the worker records
the outcome at its next checkpoint). Reconciliation writes only records from a
process that is already gone.

**Claiming a run and LAUNCHING it are separate, and the interval between them is
named.** That interval contains a disk write, so it is not instantaneous, and the
run is already in the live table while its thread does not yet exist. Three
defects came from code that had no name for that state: cleanup joined a thread
that was never started, which raised and escaped the disable so the records were
never deleted; a start that had already claimed launched into an app being
disabled; and the record said ``running`` while no worker existed. So the record
starts at ``STARTING`` and the worker itself completes the transition to
``RUNNING``, the live entry carries ``started`` as the one authority on whether
there is a thread to join, and the launch is a GUARDED transition performed under
the same lock cleanup marks with -- not an unconditional call. Each of the three
questions is now answered by reading state rather than by assuming it.

That discipline settles writer-vs-WRITER, not reader-vs-writer: a reader still
races the one writer's temp-file-plus-rename. POSIX hides this because rename is
atomic for a reader, so the reads go through ``atomic_write``'s
``read_bytes_with_retry`` -- on Windows the same instant raises
``PermissionError`` at the reader, and a record read is not optional here
(``get`` answers the HTTP surface, and ``iter_runs`` feeds reconciliation).

Staleness is decided by ``_ORIGIN``, a token minted once per gateway process —
not by pid, which can be reused by the very process doing the reconciling.
