"""App manifest — static metadata for KiroCrew apps.

An app manifest (``app.json``) declares an app's identity, resources, and
requirements without executing any app code.  KiroCrew reads it during
install to register agents, skills, crons, UI pages, and backend config.

Design follows the same pattern as :class:`kiro_crew.plugins.manifest.PluginManifest`
(dataclass + ``from_dict`` / ``to_dict`` / ``validate`` / round-trip) but with
app-specific fields.

# sync with that table (they are duplicated rather than shared to avoid a

    Whether the named slot exists is decided by the frontend registry, which
