"""Design Critique — backend API routes.

Registered at gateway startup by the ``BUILTIN_NAMES`` loop in
``dashboard/routes/system.py`` (via the package re-export in
``design_critique/__init__.py``).

These endpoints do every step that needs a shell or the filesystem — cloning a
repo, discovering its routes, and rendering screens to PNGs — server-side, so the
LLM agent never has to. The agent is then only ever asked to reason over finished
images with no tools, which is why it can no longer stall on a tool-approval
prompt that the app panel has nowhere to show.

Routes (browser-facing, same-origin authed):

  GET  /api/apps/design-critique/method    -> the critique method text to inline
  POST /api/apps/design-critique/discover  -> {kind,value} -> candidate screens
  POST /api/apps/design-critique/render     -> {kind,value,handle,picks} -> PNGs
