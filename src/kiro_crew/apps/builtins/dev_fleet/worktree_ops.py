    ``<remote>/<base branch>`` cannot serve for this: it is a MUTABLE name, and
    the status refresher re-fetches it every ``_NET_REFRESH_S`` seconds in this
    same process. Resolving that name once in the probe and again in the merge --
    with a real install in between -- lets the two land on different commits, so
    the probe would certify a revision the merge does not install. Fetching the
    tip into a ref of our own closes the window instead of narrowing it: the
    refresher's fetch writes only the remote-tracking refs, so nothing can move
    this one for the life of the run.

    The PID is part of the name because ``_SYNC_LOCK`` is a lock in ONE process,
    which makes syncs single-flight only within a single gateway. Two gateways
    configured against the same checkout would otherwise share this ref, and the
    second one's fetch would move it between the first one's probe and merge --
    reopening exactly the window the ref exists to close. That configuration is
    already destructive for a bigger reason (two syncs running ``git merge`` and
    ``npm ci`` against one working tree), so this does not make concurrent syncs
    safe; it only stops one gateway from invalidating another's probe.

    Safe to force and safe to reuse: the fetch step rewrites it before any step
    reads it, so a value left by an earlier run -- or by an earlier process that
    happened to hold this PID -- can never be consumed.

    The PID in the ref name is what stops two gateways on one checkout from

    ordinary restart strands it, and so does a killed run. Without this every
    gateway generation would leave one behind in the OPERATOR's own checkout,
    bounded only by ``pid_max`` and visible in ``git for-each-ref`` forever.

    A ref whose PID is still alive is LEFT ALONE. It may be a second gateway's
    live pin, and deleting that would reopen exactly the window the PID suffix
    exists to close -- so the prune is bounded by the number of live gateways,
    which is the real floor. Liveness goes through
    ``platform_compat.pid_exists``: a raw ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` is a liveness probe
    only on POSIX, and on Windows it TERMINATES the process it is asked about --
    which here would mean killing the very live gateway this is meant to spare.
    ``pid_exists`` also collapses "exists but we cannot signal it" into alive,
    which is the answer we want: unsure means do not touch.

    Best-effort throughout: this is housekeeping, and a sync must not fail

    every mutating pod path cooperates on. That is the whole point of this
    helper: checking the checkout pin in one process and then tearing down in
    another leaves a window where a concurrent ``pod up`` from a DIFFERENT
    checkout claims the same global basename, so the teardown would stop that
    pod and delete its isolated HOME. Reading the pin under the same lock the
    teardown holds closes it.

    Necessarily in-process rather than via the ``pod down`` CLI: the lock is held
    per open-file-description and ``stop_pod`` re-acquires it, so a caller that
    held it around a shell-out would block the very child it waits on.
    ``pod_name_mutex`` is reentrant WITHIN A THREAD, and this function is
    submitted to the executor as one callable, so ``stop_pod``'s own acquisition
    nests instead of deadlocking.

    *expected_checkout* is this repo's worktree path for *name*, resolved by the
    caller before the lock -- it is not the racy half, since a foreign ``up``
    moves the PIN, never our own worktree.

    Mirrors :func:`_pod_checkout_guard`'s attribution rules, and the CLI's
    post-teardown env-file clear, so behaviour matches the paths it replaces.

    """Remove a feature worktree while its per-worktree lock is held.

    Non-forced removal of merged PRs uses a SQUASH-SAFE race guard: fetches
    the PR's headRefOid via `gh` and requires the worktree branch's current
    OID == the PR's merged headRefOid. Commits pushed after merge cause OID
    divergence and refuse the removal (unlike git cherry which never works
    for squash merges).

    ``discard_untracked_paths`` is a NARROWER request than ``force``, not a
    synonym: it authorizes destroying exactly the untracked files the caller
    LISTED (session scratch -- probe scripts, capture harnesses, notes) and
    nothing else, so it is honoured only while NO tracked file is modified AND
    the listed set still matches what is on disk. Carrying the set rather than a
    boolean is what makes "you consented to what you were shown" enforceable
    instead of merely asserted. It does not speak to whether the branch's
    commits are shipped, so an unmerged branch still needs ``force`` in
    addition. Both together are still refused if a tracked file is modified.

    Lock order (must never be reversed to prevent deadlock):
      _wt_lock(name)  →  _MAKE_LIVE_LOCK  →  _GIT_MUTATION_LOCK
    The wrapper owns _wt_lock(name) for this entire function. The make-live
    lock is held from the protection re-check through destructive deletion,
    so neither rebase nor a live cutover can claim the target concurrently.

    # not atomic: it renames the dist-info aside and deletes the editable `.pth`
    # before it reaches the locked script, rolling back neither. So
    # `pip install -e .` must not run against a venv serving this gateway.
    #
    # It does not have to run at all, though. An editable install needs no
    # reinstall for a source change -- `src` is already on `sys.path`, so merged
    # code is live the moment the merge lands. The only thing the reinstall was
    # still buying is a dependency a new revision added, and installing a
    # dependency never touches the project's own console script.
    #
    # The substitute keeps the SAME shape as the reinstall it stands in for:
    # `fetch -> merge -> install the project's requirements`, in that order, with
    # the project itself left out. Deviating from that shape -- installing before
    # the merge so a failure cannot strand a merged checkout -- was tried and
    # abandoned: it requires proving in advance that the merge cannot fail, which
    # needs a growing set of preconditions that still cannot be complete. A failed
    # install after a landed merge is what every other platform already does when
    # its reinstall step fails.
    #
    # The substitute step runs with THIS backend's interpreter for the same
    # reason the build+stage step does: the logic is revision-independent, so
    # resolving it from the target would make the step's very EXISTENCE
    # contingent on the pulled revision carrying dep_sync.
    #
    # It runs a pre-merge SNAPSHOT of that module, by path, and neither half of
    # that is incidental. `-m kiro_crew...dep_sync` would import the module from
    # the working tree AFTER the merge has landed, dragging in the whole package
    # __init__ chain with it -- so a revision that raises the `requires-python`
    # floor and uses newer syntax anywhere in that chain would die with a
    # SyntaxError while being parsed, and the floor refusal that exists for
    # exactly that revision could never run. Copying the module first and
    # executing the copy keeps the only parsed file one this interpreter has
    # already imported, which makes the refusal reachable in the case it is
    # written for. Running it by path rather than by module name is what keeps
    # the package chain out of it; the module imports nothing but the standard
    # library, so it needs no package context.
    #
    # This mirrors pip rather than deviating from it: the INSTALLED pip reads the
    # merged project's metadata, and an old pip refusing a too-new project is the
    # behaviour being stood in for here.
    # The fetch pins the tip it brought into this process's own base ref as well
    # as updating the remote-tracking ref, so the probe below and the merge here
    # consume ONE commit even though the refresher keeps fetching underneath

    # A backend-only sync -- one that changes nothing under website/ -- pays both
    # frontend costs above for nothing: `npm ci` deletes and reinstalls a tree
    # from an unchanged lockfile, and the build re-produces a bundle byte-for-
    # byte identical to the one already staged. Both are elided on one runtime
    # verdict, which is where that cost is repaid.
    #
    # The decision is made at RUNTIME, inside the generated runner, not here:
    # the only evidence is a diff against sync_base_ref, and that ref does not
    # exist on disk until the fetch step (above, first in every branch) runs --
    # the step list is assembled before fetch. So the two steps are still
    # ASSEMBLED (the runner decides whether to run or skip them), and each is
    # TAGGED with the same marker carrying sync_base_ref, mirroring how the npm
    # ci step is tagged with `stash` and the runner acts on it in its loop.
    #
    # The diff's OTHER side is resolved HERE, before the run, and travels in the
    # marker. It must NOT be spelled HEAD in the runner: the runner reaches the
    # frontend steps only after the `git merge --ff-only sync_base_ref` step has
    # fast-forwarded HEAD onto that very ref, so `git diff HEAD <ref>` would
    # compare the ref with itself, read empty on EVERY successful sync, and turn
    # the gate into an unconditional skip that elides the build for a sync whose
    # whole content is a website/ change. Nothing between this line and the merge
    # moves HEAD -- the fetch writes refs only and the preflight just reads -- and
    # _SYNC_LOCK excludes a second sync, so this OID is the merge's true starting
    # point. An unresolvable HEAD means no marker at all (build as today).
    #
    # COUPLED on purpose: both steps share ONE cause (no website/ change) and one
    # evidence check, and they skip together or neither skips. Skipping the build
    # without the reinstall, or the reverse, has no coherent meaning -- a build
    # over the existing tree only reproduces the staged bundle when that tree
    # already matches the lockfile, which is the very condition frontend_skip
    # verifies. So both carry the marker; the runner evaluates the evidence ONCE.
    #
    # EDITION path is unaffected: on an edition checkout frontend_half is false,
    # so neither step is in the list and nothing carries the marker -- the runtime
    # skip is a guarded no-op there (a step without the marker key is never a
    # skip candidate). The block below only runs when the steps are present.
    #
    # DIST freshness: the diff-empty gate is exactly what makes declining to
    # rebuild safe. When the merge changes nothing under website/, the bundle the
    # build would produce is the one already staged, so serving the existing dist
    # serves the same bytes. A dist stale for a reason UNRELATED to any sync is a
    # pre-existing condition this sync neither created nor is obligated to repair,
    # and -- because it touches nothing under website/ -- would not have changed
    # it either way. Staleness an EARLIER SYNC created is NOT waved through the
    # same way: a sync that merged website/ changes and then failed at the build
    # leaves a bundle older than the source, and the retry that used to repair it
    # is exactly the shape the skip fires on (its own diff is empty, because that
    # merge already landed), so frontend_skip also requires the served bundle to
    # BE the last build's output. The skip is conservative throughout: it requires
    # the on-disk node_modules to VERIFIABLY match the incoming lockfile (npm's
    # own hidden lockfile), a stronger bar than "node_modules non-empty", and
    # returns "do not skip" on any weak or unobtainable evidence.

    also surfaces an "empty + stale >48h" class; silently auto-deleting an
    unmerged empty branch (e.g. one created but not yet pushed) on a timer is
    surprising, so that riskier class stays MANUAL-only ("Prune merged"). Each

    The ``closed`` class (PR CLOSED without merging) is DELIBERATELY excluded

    worktree is safe to delete because its content is on the base branch by

    of work that never landed (measured on a real fleet: one closed worktree
    held a multi-hundred-line uncommitted rewrite, another held brand-new
    untracked source files in no commit and no PR). Reaping that on a timer,
    with no human to read the loss summary, would destroy it irrecoverably.
