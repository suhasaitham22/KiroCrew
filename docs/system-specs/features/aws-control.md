# AWS Control

AWS Control is the builtin account portal and S3-backed drive. It registers
selected local AWS profiles, groups their live identity probes by AWS account,
and exposes Drive, Library, Backup, cost, share, and IAM-policy views. The
builtin is declared by `kiro_crew.apps.builtins` and mounted by
`aws_control.backend.routes.register_routes`; the dashboard surface is
`website/src/apps/aws-control/`.

## Access boundary

Every AWS Control route passes `routes._guarded`. It refuses a disabled app and
any caller that is not the dashboard owner, and records either denial in SEL.
`test_aws_control_app.py::TestRouteRegistration.test_every_route_refuses_non_owner_when_enabled`
pins the owner boundary.

Every mutating route additionally passes `routes._mutating`. It refuses
restricted sessions and emits an SEL outcome for success, refusal, or an
`AWSError`; this is load-bearing because a restricted or non-owner session must
not turn an ordinary dashboard request into an AWS mutation. The mutating route
registrations in `routes.register_routes` cover profile registration, drive
operations, shares, library publication, and backup operations.

Account-targeted operations resolve the registered profile and then re-probe
its live identity in `routes._account_target`. A profile that has been repointed
to another account is refused instead of being used for the account named in
the URL. `test_aws_control_storage.py::TestFindDrive.test_a_bucket_owned_by_another_account_is_refused`
pins the related storage ownership check.

## Credentials and paid-service consent

The profile registry in `deploy.profiles` stores profile metadata, not keys or
tokens. It discovers names through the AWS CLI and writes only its allowlisted
configuration keys through `aws configure`; `credential_process` is a stored
command, not credential material. This separation is load-bearing because the
gateway passes profile names to the CLI provider chain rather than persisting
AWS secrets itself.

`aws_consent.GATED_SERVICES` includes S3 and Cost Explorer. A grant is scoped
to service, profile, region, and the account returned by the identity probe.
`aws_consent.authorize` consults a short-cached live identity probe before it
allows a gated call and withdraws a mismatched grant; unreadable, absent,
changed, or unresolved grants refuse the operation.
`test_aws_control_app.py::TestConsentExtension` pins the AWS Control service
registrations, and
`test_aws_control_app.py::TestDriveGuards.test_consent_refusal_answers_409_before_any_aws_call`
pins refusal before the drive handler calls AWS.

AWS Control reaches AWS through deploy-engine helpers: account inspection uses
`deploy.engine.run_aws`, while storage uses `deploy.engine._checked`. The engine
constructs fixed AWS CLI argument vectors with a profile name and runs the CLI
through the standard subprocess sandbox. The app does not import an AWS SDK.

## Drive and destructive operations

`storage.find_drive` discovers a drive by its managed tags, validates the bucket
name, and verifies bucket ownership against the requested account. Ambiguous or
unverifiable discovery refuses. The result is deliberately not cached: a bucket
identity is an authorization decision, not a display value.

`storage.create_drive` creates a bucket only after the bootstrap handler's
preview-plus-confirm flow. `routes._handle_drive_bootstrap` rechecks the
account target and S3 consent after confirmation and serializes creation so
concurrent confirmations cannot create competing drives.
`test_aws_control_app.py::TestDriveGuards.test_bootstrap_without_confirm_previews_and_creates_nothing`,
`TestDriveGuards.test_concurrent_bootstrap_confirms_create_exactly_one_drive`,
and `TestDriveGuards.test_consent_withdrawn_mid_create_refuses_and_creates_nothing`
pin those guarantees.

A created drive is ownership-checked before it becomes discoverable. The storage
layer enables versioning and then calls `deploy.engine._harden_bucket`, which
sets S3 Block Public Access, bucket-owner-enforced ownership controls, default
SSE, and the discovery tags. The order is load-bearing: a partially configured
bucket is left untagged rather than becoming a usable drive without versioning.
`test_aws_control_storage.py::TestCreateDrive.test_versioning_is_enabled_before_hardening_tags_land`
pins the sequence.

Drive objects live beneath the `artifacts/`, `drive/`, and `backup/` prefixes.
`storage.validate_key` rejects paths that could escape a section. Folder deletion
uses a validated, slash-anchored prefix, so it cannot target an empty section,
the bucket root, or a sibling with a common name prefix.
`test_aws_control_routes.py::TestFolderDelete.test_delete_rejects_an_empty_path`
and `test_aws_control_storage.py::TestDeletePrefix.test_deletes_every_object_and_returns_the_count`
pin that guard.

At the API layer, object and folder deletion do not require a `confirm`
parameter. The dashboard shows a confirmation strip before either deletion, and
`routes._handle_drive_delete` and `routes._handle_drive_folder_delete` then
execute after the owner, restricted-session, S3-consent, and key-scope guards.
On the versioned drive, `storage.delete_key` writes an S3 delete marker rather
than purging historical versions. This is the current recovery property; the
app does not implement a version purge.

## Publishing and sharing

`routes._publish_gate` applies the shared fail-closed publish-governance decision
before a library push, a download presign, or a share presign. This guard is
load-bearing because each operation makes bytes reachable outside the local
machine.

The share implementation is a presigned URL and a local metadata ledger only.
`storage.presign` clamps the requested lifetime to the S3 signing limit, while
`shares.record_share` stores metadata and expiry but never the URL. A presigned
URL cannot be revoked by this app before it expires; `shares.forget_share` only
removes its ledger record. Backup objects are not shareable.
`test_aws_control_app.py::TestDriveGuards.test_share_of_backup_section_is_refused_outright`
and `test_aws_control_routes.py::TestSharesListForget.test_forget_removes_a_known_share`
pin those boundaries.

AWS Control does not create bucket-policy account grants or public CDN shares.
The IAM-policy endpoint renders `deploy.iam.policy_json` for the operator to
apply; it does not write IAM policy.

## Library, costs, and backup

`library.push_artifact` copies a selected artifact through the Drive storage
layer after the route's S3-consent and publish-governance checks. It refuses
credential-bearing artifact content; `test_aws_control_app.py::TestLibraryScan.test_credential_bearing_artifact_is_refused`
pins that egress boundary.

`library.library_remove` deletes the whole `artifacts/<slug>/` prefix and then
forgets the slug's ledger record. The order is load-bearing rather than
transactional: a local file and a remote bucket cannot be committed as one, and
objects-then-record leaves at worst a record the bucket does not back, which
`library.reconcile` repairs. The reverse order would leave objects that no
surface lists. Removal writes delete markers on the versioned bucket, so it
empties the listing rather than reaching billing-zero; a version purge remains
outstanding, as it does for the Drive's own deletes.

`library.reconcile` is the direction that makes the ledger's "display state, not
truth" claim hold: it drops records the bucket does not back and never invents a
record for a cloud copy it finds, because version and push time live in that
copy's sidecar. It prunes only what the bucket has had a chance to disprove — a
record stamped at or after the listing it is judged against is left alone, since
that listing predates the record — so a push completing mid-render does not lose
its record. `routes._handle_library_list` reconciles before joining local
artifacts, and reports whether the bucket was actually read — a failed, absent,
or unconsented read leaves the rows rendering as an unverified ledger claim
rather than as an authoritative empty. It reads the prefix through
`storage.list_library_folders`, which is unredacted and completely paginated
because a reconcile reasons about absence; the paged, redacted display listing
cannot answer that question. `library._update_ledger` is the ledger's only
writer, so push, removal, and reconcile cannot drop each other's records.

`routes._library_lock` serializes the three Library operations on one drive —
push, removal, and the reconcile read. Each is a network round trip followed by a
ledger write, and interleaving two of them corrupts state neither half can
detect: a push completing between the reconcile's listing and its prune, or a
push racing a removal of the same slug past the delete sweep. The ledger's file
lock cannot serve this — it covers a sub-second read plus rename by design.

The two mutations wait on that lock unbounded — they are user-initiated actions
that may legitimately queue — but the render path waits only
`_LIBRARY_RECONCILE_LOCK_WAIT_SECS` and then reports `reconciled: false`. A push
holds the lock across an upload allowed up to 600s, and a page render must not
hang for that; skipping loses nothing durable because the reconcile is
self-correcting, so the next render performs it. Errors on this path already
degrade rather than failing, and slowness degrades the same way.

Because that lock makes a caller WAIT, all three operations re-run their
authorization inside it via `routes._reauthorize_in_lock` — app enabled, then live
identity still resolving to the requested account, then S3 consent, then the drive
bucket re-resolved and compared, plus publish governance for the push. This is the
same re-check `_handle_drive_upload` runs after its spool and for the same reason:
the wait sits between the checks that authorized the call and the call itself. The
bucket is included because tag discovery can return a different bucket while the
identity is unchanged, and this module keeps no bucket-name cache precisely
because that identity must not be stale. The reconcile read is included because a
listing is still a call into a paid service; on the read path a failed re-check
degrades to "not reconciled" rather than an error, so the local half still
renders, and so does a ledger that cannot be written — the rows are renderable,
they are merely unverified. The degraded identity denial is SEL-audited even
though the route does not fail on it: a permission decision reaches SEL whether or
not it becomes an error response.

`library_remove` CONFIRMS the prefix is gone before touching the ledger.
`delete_prefix` deliberately degrades on an unreadable listing page — it stops the
walk and reports the count so far, so it can under-delete — and forgetting a record
on that would drop a copy still in the bucket while reporting the removal as done.
A slug still present raises instead, leaving the record intact.

The lock is per-process, so a second gateway sharing the data home is still a
racer. `library._recorded_at_or_after` is that cross-process guard, one rule
asked by both operations: reconcile will not prune, and removal will not forget,
a record written at or after the remote observation each is acting on. Both
cutoffs are read BEFORE their observation begins, never after — a cutoff that
postdates its own observation protects nothing, because a record written in the
gap compares as older than it. Reading early only widens the set of records left
alone, and a record left behind whose objects were really removed is merely
stale, which the next render repairs.

Soundness also depends on `pushedAt` being stamped when the record is WRITTEN —
inside the ledger lock, after the uploads have succeeded — not when the push
began; a pre-upload stamp would read older than a listing that ran during a slow
upload. The metadata sidecar keeps its own pre-upload stamp, which is what remote
metadata should say about when the push started.

Cloud copies with no local artifact row are reported to the caller as
`remoteOnly` rather than being hidden: `list_pushable` walks the local store, so
a copy pushed from another machine has no row to carry it and would otherwise be
unreachable from the console that must be able to remove it.

`costs.fetch_month_costs` calls Cost Explorer for the requested linked account
and groups results by service. `routes._handle_costs` serves a fresh local cache
without a new consent check; a stale cache is returned with its stale state when
Cost Explorer consent is absent or a refresh fails. This keeps the Bill view
available without misrepresenting a cached value as fresh.

`backup.run_snapshot_backup` uploads a generated snapshot archive, and
`backup.run_sessions_backup` archives session material only when descriptor-based
traversal pinning is available. `backup._authorize_upload` requires the app to
remain enabled, the S3 grant to still name the target account, and shutdown not
to be in progress before upload. `backup.restore_download` stages an archive
locally; it does not restore it into live gateway state.
`test_aws_control_app.py::TestRound22Hardening.test_restore_refuses_a_symlinked_destination`
pins the staged restore safety boundary.

The nightly toggle records whether an account is eligible for a scheduled
snapshot. `aws_control.hooks._run_once` resolves an account and drive, checks
S3 consent, runs only due backups, and SEL-audits invocation, success, and
failure. It skips unavailable accounts or absent drives rather than creating
resources itself.

## HTTP surface

`routes.register_routes` exposes owner-gated reads for accounts, available
profiles, reconnect guidance, drive status/list/download, costs, library,
backup status, share metadata, and rendered IAM policy. Its mutations are
profile registration; drive bootstrap, upload, delete, folder create/delete,
and share; share-ledger removal; library push and library removal; backup run,
nightly toggle, and staged restore.

Drive bootstrap is the only API-level preview-plus-confirm flow. Upload, profile
registration, library push, library removal, share creation, and backup
mutations have no separate confirmation request; the dashboard separately
confirms object deletion, folder deletion, and library removal. Library removal
is gated the way folder deletion is: the picker's per-card Remove control reveals
an inline Cancel-plus-danger strip naming the artifact, and that strip stays open
until the request resolves, so a failed delete renders on the card instead of
vanishing with the confirm. Every mutation is owner-gated, restricted-session
refused, and SEL-audited. Account-targeted AWS operations additionally enforce
live identity and service consent, and egress paths enforce publish governance.
Library removal is deliberately outside that egress set: it sends no bytes out,
so a profile that denies publishing can still empty a bucket it is paying for.
