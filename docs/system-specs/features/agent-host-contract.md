# Agent host contract

What an agent backend must supply to Kiro Crew *besides* speaking the Agent Client
Protocol. ACP defines the wire; this document defines the **host** — the
filesystem layout, agent-definition format, session store, credential store,
sandbox posture, MCP delivery channel, billing surface, and permission engine
that sit around the wire and differ per backend.

Three backends are described, and **all three are selectable on a plain public
build**. The baseline registry `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS` (`acp_backends.py`)
contains every id in `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`; there is no frozen
`ACP_BACKENDS_SELECTABLE` constant any more, because the set is a registry an
edition may extend and a deployment policy may narrow. An earlier revision of
this document described Claude Code as a dormant seam that only an internal
companion package could reach. That was wrong: `acp/client.py` owns the entire CC
spawn path (`_is_claude`, `_resolve_claude_acp_bin`,
`_resolve_claude_code_executable`), `providers/acp.py` constructs it, and the
adapter it spawns is a public npm package
(`CLAUDE_ACP_NPM_PKG = "@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp"`). Nothing in the
spawn path is edition-private; the selector switch was the only missing piece.

What actually varies for CC is **machine-local**: it needs two binaries the
operator installs — the `claude-agent-acp` adapter and the `claude` CLI handed to
it as `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE`. That is a third question, kept apart from the
other two on purpose: capability (`acp_backends.py`, can this build drive the
harness), permission (the `agent_backend` governance scope, may this deployment
select it), and installation (`agent_sdk/backend_install.py`, is it on this
machine). Only the third can change without a config write or a new build, and it
is the one that reports `installed` / `missing` / `unknown` per component with the
command that installs the adapter. A backend this deployment may not select is
**hidden** from the dashboard rather than greyed out, so no "not enabled in this
build" state is rendered for any agent.

See [claude-code-provider.md](claude-code-provider.md) for why the standalone
`ClaudeCodeProvider` class was removed in the KiroACP-only refactor — the ACP
provider is still the only admissible `AgentConfig.provider`, and a backend is
chosen through `agent.acp_backend` rather than by adding a provider class — and
[../modules/acp-client.md](../modules/acp-client.md) for the seam's protocol-level
details.

Claude Code is the only backend in this table that is a genuinely *foreign* host.
KAS is Kiro's own agent service reached through `kiro-cli acp`, so it shares
Kiro's identity store, runtime and model vocabulary. That is why the CC column,
not the KAS column, is what tells a future provider author what they are actually
signing up for.

Where a CC row is marked **(companion)**, the behaviour is supplied by an
internal companion package rather than by this repository, and is described here
by what it does. The companion is not public and its internals are deliberately
not cited: what a provider author needs from this table is the *requirement*, not
where one implementation happens to satisfy it.

Those rows are not what makes CC *reachable* — the spawn path is public and a
public build starts a CC session without any of them. They are what makes it
*complete*. A build that overrides none of them runs a working harness with pieces
missing, and the largest of those is stated plainly in §5: a CC session with zero
MCP tools.

## Column meaning

| Column | Backend |
|---|---|
| **kiro-cli** | `ACP_BACKEND_KIRO = ""` — the default. Kiro's CLI over ACP. |
| **KAS** | `ACP_BACKEND_KAS = "kas"` — Kiro's agent service, run through `kiro-cli acp --agent-engine v3 --auth-method cli`. |
| **CC** | `ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE = "claude"` — `claude-agent-acp`. Selectable on a public build; usable on a given machine once the operator has installed both the adapter and the `claude` CLI. |

## 1. Agent definition and layout

| | kiro-cli | KAS | CC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where a managed agent lives | `~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json` (+ `-lite`, `-conductor`, `-knowledge`, `-research`, `-heartbeat` variants, `agent_files.py:20-27`) | Nowhere on disk — agents ride `_meta.kiro.customAgents` on `session/new` (`acp/kas_agents.py:1-8`) | `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md`, Markdown with YAML frontmatter (companion: a JSON→Markdown agent translator writes it) |
| Format | JSON, validated with `deny_unknown_fields`; an unknown key silently falls back to the default agent, which is why bookkeeping lives in an `agent_state` sidecar (`agent.py:2645-2651`) | JSON projected onto the wire; `prompt` must be inlined, and `tools` absent means *no* tools (`kas_agents.py:11-16`) | YAML frontmatter (`name/description/model/permissionMode/tools/mcpServers/disallowedTools/hooks`) plus the system prompt as the body |
| Selection mechanism | `--agent <name>`; `$PWD/.kiro/agents` shadows `~/.kiro/agents` (`agent_discovery.py:46-51`) | `session/set_mode` against a wire-supplied agent | No `--agent` and **no `set_mode` at all**; the agent-activation privilege check is skipped (`acp/client.py:3513-3536`) |
| Hook event names | Crew's own | Hooks cannot ride an over-the-wire agent (`kas_agents.py:20-27`) | Renamed: `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `SessionStart` / `Stop` (companion) |
| Model pin | `model` in the spec; `"auto"` resolvable | Not projected | Separate `cc_model` sidecar field; cannot resolve `"auto"`, so background agents get a concrete pin (`agent.py:235-243`) |
| Protocol version | date-stamped `2025-08-22` | date-stamped | numeric `1` (`acp/client.py:150-152`, `:3376-3379`) |

**A provider must declare:** its definition target (or that there is none), its
validation strictness, whether bookkeeping may live in-spec, its
shadowing/selection rules, its hook-event vocabulary, whether it can resolve an
`"auto"` model, and its protocol-version shape.

## 2. Session persistence

| | kiro-cli | KAS | CC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Replay store | `<kiro home>/sessions/cli/<sid>.json` + `.jsonl`, read to resume (`session_storage.py:7-11`) | same store (it *is* kiro-cli) | Its own: `<cc root>/projects/<encoded cwd>/<sid>.jsonl` + `<sid>/`, plus `<cc root>/file-history/<sid>/` (companion: a dedicated transcript-cleanup module exists for exactly this) |
| Store root | `KIRO_HOME` | `KIRO_HOME` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` → `<config dir>/cc-config` → `~/.claude` (companion) |
| Directory naming | session id | session id | `realpath(cwd)` with every non-alphanumeric replaced by `-`. **`realpath`, not `abspath`** — on cloud desktops `/home/<user>` is a symlink to `/local/home/<user>`, and an abspath encoding silently misses the transcript directory (companion) |
| `session/load` | carries the transcript path, guarded by a file-exists pre-check (`acp/client.py:3416-3417`) | same | carries **no** path; the pre-check is skipped entirely (`acp/client.py:3408-3414`) |
| Compaction | asynchronous, reported by `_kiro.dev/compaction/status`; the session id changes | same | `/compact` runs **synchronously inside `session/prompt`**; no status notification ever arrives, and the session id survives (`dashboard/chat_runner.py:8200-8213`) |
| Sessions per process | many (demultiplexed over `AcpRuntime`) | many | **one** (`acp/types.py:170-180`) |
| History replay | full history every turn, so one oversized image block wedges a transcript permanently and Crew repairs kiro-cli's own file (`session_image_repair.py:1-24`) | same | not applicable |

**A provider must declare:** its replay-store path and naming (or that it has
none), its store root and how that root is recomputable from config alone,
whether `session/load` needs a local transcript, its compaction model
(synchronous or reported), how many sessions share a process, and whether it
replays full history.

## 3. Identity and auth

| | kiro-cli | KAS | CC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sign-in | `kiro-cli login`; SSO `--use-device-flow --license pro` (`kiro_prerequisite.py:80,90`) | same | brings its own: a credential-refresh **command** named inside its own `settings.json`, plus a provider-routing env var on the child (companion) |
| Credential store | projected, never copied: identity tables plus `migrations` rows plus selected `state` rows (`kiro_prerequisite.py:182-200`) | same store | its own; that refresh command is copied **verbatim** into the isolated seed at `0o600`. Dropping it breaks auth outright, so the seed cannot simply be emptied (companion) |
| Recyclable on a host logout | yes | yes (`ACP_BACKENDS_KIRO_IDENTITY_STORE`, `acp/types.py:182-196`) | **no** — a live CC child must survive `kiro-cli logout` |
| Entitlement discovery | account API | account API | runtime, from the advertised model set at session init; the registry is filtered down to it (`dashboard/handlers/agents.py:1151-1160`) |
| Readiness probe | `--version` then `whoami`, inside the OS sandbox (`kiro_prerequisite.py:4-7`) | same | binary resolution only, but for **both** components and through the spawn's own resolvers, so the answer cannot disagree with what a spawn does (`agent_sdk/backend_install.py`, `agent_sdk/drivers/acp.py`) |

**A provider must declare:** its login and org-SSO commands, its credential
locations, whether a host logout may retire its live children, how entitlement is
discovered, and its readiness probe.

The membership set is named `ACP_BACKENDS_KIRO_IDENTITY_STORE`, but its meaning is
*authorization*, not ownership: it records that a `kiro-cli logout` may retire
this backend's live child. A provider that brings its own auth is excluded, and
the exclusion is load-bearing.

## 4. Sandbox

| | kiro-cli | KAS | CC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Self-sandboxing | yes, ≥ 2.13, via `~/.kiro/settings/amazon-internal.json` key `"sandbox"` (`sandbox.py:2252-2262`) | KAS-owned Seatbelt/Bubblewrap, not passed by kiro-cli | **no** — "a Node or Python harness does not qualify" (`acp/types.py:160-167`) |
| Interaction with Crew's sandbox | mutually exclusive on macOS: internal ON → Crew seatbelt OFF, because seatbelt cannot nest (`sandbox.py:2257-2258`) | Crew seatbelt remains the sole isolation layer | Crew keeps its own wrap |
| Delegation predicate | `argv[0]` basename is literally `kiro-cli` (`sandbox.py:2305-2316`) | same binary | never delegates |
| Extra hidden paths | core tiers | core tiers | adds `.midway`/`.ada`/`.aws`/`sso`/`.krb5`, ADD-only on both tiers (companion) |

Every detection failure resolves toward Crew's own sandbox (`sandbox.py:2269-2300`).

**A provider must declare:** whether it self-sandboxes and how that is detected,
its nesting compatibility, its delegation predicate, and any additional paths its
credentials occupy. An unknown provider defaults to *not* self-sandboxing.

## 5. MCP server injection

| | kiro-cli | KAS | CC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delivery channel | reads the agent file; Crew rewrites copies into `<config dir>/mcp-gateway/agents/` and injects stubs per session over `session/new`, which outranks the same-named agent-spec entry (`mcp_gateway/rewriter.py:3-8`) | not projected at all (`kas_agents.py:20-27`) | reads **no file**; servers must be passed as the `mcpServers` parameter on **both** `session/new` and `session/load` (`acp/client.py:3300-3311`, `:3425-3434`) |
| Shape | agent-file JSON | — | different: `env` and `headers` are **required arrays** of `{"name","value"}` and the transport `type` must be explicit (a url with no `type` is routed to the stdio branch and rejected for having no command); omitting either array fails the whole `session/new` with `-32602 expected array, received undefined`, so both are always emitted — empty when there is nothing to carry (`acp/session_mcp.py`) |
| Public-core default | real | — | real: `_session_mcp_servers()` translates the materialized kiro agent spec into the array on every spawn (`acp/session_mcp.py`, `session_mcp_servers`). The spec stays the single source of truth — there is no second, CC-shaped registry — so installing or toggling a server takes effect on the **next session** with no gateway restart. The spec's `tools` references are honoured, so an entry kiro-cli would declare but not mount (every `opt_in` grant, and any hand-narrowed spec) cannot come alive just because the session ran on CC; `type: "registry"` catalog pointers are withheld (CC cannot resolve a registry, and their command/url are placeholders kiro-cli itself ignores); Crew's own `kirocrew-core` / `kirocrew-cron` are re-derived from the managed source (`agent.managed_mcp_spec_entry`) so a stale hand-edited command cannot cost a session its control plane. A missing or malformed spec degrades to the control plane alone, never to a failed spawn |
| Env expansion | Crew reimplements kiro-cli's expander byte-for-byte: unresolved `${VAR}` stays literal, `env:` prefix dropped (`mcp_gateway/rewriter.py:260-268`) | — | adapter-side |
| Loader strictness | an `mcpServers` entry without a command makes kiro-cli reject the whole agent file, surfacing as "Mode not found" at session time while `agent list`/`validate` still pass (`apps/bridges.py:445-460`) | — | frontmatter-scoped |
| Auto-approve bypass | `allowedTools` is the one path that never reaches `hooks.on_tool_call` (`apps/bridges.py:388-393`) | KAS `rules` array | see §7 |
| Tool-name grammar | `@server/tool` split on `/`, so slash-bearing keys are slugged or expose zero tools (`mcp_utils.py:288-302`) | — | `mcp__server`; `fs_read`→`Read`, `execute_bash`→`Bash`; `use_aws` has no equivalent and is dropped (companion) |

**A provider must declare:** its injection channel and precedence rule, its
server shape, its env-expansion semantics, its loader strictness, which field (if
any) bypasses the permission callback, and its tool-reference grammar.

## 6. Usage, billing, credits

| | kiro-cli | KAS | CC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Kiro credits (`bills_kiro_credits`, membership-only and False for unknown ids) | Kiro credits | US dollars per token |
| Quota API | RTS endpoints, target prefix `com.amazon.aws.codewhisperer.runtime.AmazonCodeWhispererService` (`dashboard/handlers/kiro_usage_api.py:100-108`) | same | none; cost is computed from token counts |
| Token discovery | `data.sqlite3` across four per-OS locations × two product names, four key spellings (`kiro_usage_api.py:168-192`) | same | not applicable |
| Consumer surface | a boolean flag read by the session readout and `dashboard/state.py` | same | `GET /api/usage/cost` returns `mode="cost"` vs `mode="kiro"`, plus a companion-side budget cap (companion) |

This is the best-sealed bucket: consumers read a flag, not the endpoints.

**A provider must declare:** its billing unit, its quota API (or none), how its
token is discovered, and its unattributable-overhead model.

## 7. Security and permission parity

| | kiro-cli | KAS | CC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where denial is enforced | Crew's own PreToolUse gate; built-in deny rules are **not** injected into the agent spec (`security.py:50-58`) | same | CC has a **native** permission engine that runs *upstream of and invisible to* the host `canUseTool` gate |
| Deny-pattern engine | authored for kiro-cli's linear-time RE2-style engine; two patterns are catastrophic under Python `re`, so a behaviourally identical linear matcher is substituted (`security.py:1864-1868`) | same | regex, not globs — Crew translates globs with metacharacter escaping (companion) |
| Auto-approve vocabulary | `allowedTools` | `{"rules":[{"capability":"mcp","match":["srv/*"],"effect":"allow"}]}`; unmatched → `ask`; `match` omitted → `['**']` (`acp/kas_permissions.py:1-42`) | frontmatter `tools`; `deniedCommands` → `disallowedTools: ["Bash(<cmd>)"]` |
| Permission-request options | `allow_once` / `allow_always`, with a `cancelled` fallback for deny | kiro vocabulary | `allow` / `allow_always` **and a real `reject`** (`acp/session_handle.py:1137-1170`) |
| Auto mode | protocol flag | protocol flag | a per-session **file**: `<work dir>/.claude/settings.local.json`, `permissions.defaultMode`, written by `_write_claude_local_settings` for the *next* spawn. The work dir is frequently a project the user also uses with CC by hand, so the writer **snapshots** any pre-existing file (bytes plus mode) and merges Crew's keys over it; on reset the snapshot is restored byte-for-byte, or the file is removed when Crew created it. Either way no `bypassPermissions` Crew asked for survives a crash, and a file Crew never seeded is left alone (`acp/types.py:222-232`, `acp/client.py`) |
| Inherited-config hazard | — | omitting `permissions` resolves everything to `ask` | an inherited `defaultMode: dontAsk`, or any inherited `allow`/`ask` wildcard, is auto-approved by CC's engine **without calling `canUseTool`**, silently bypassing Crew's gate — so `defaultMode`/`allow`/`ask` are stripped from the seed (companion) |
| Rules Crew cannot override | — | shell/filesystem families are refused rather than translated | the user's own deny rules run first; a detector fnmatches them against benign canaries (`ls`, `git status`, `pwd`) and **surfaces** what it cannot beat (companion) |
| Tool-call titles | prefixed `Reading `/`Running: ` | prefixed | no prefix, so sensitive-path gates must run on every target (`hooks.py:559-563`) |

**The parity rule this bucket establishes:** when a foreign host lacks an
enforcement *mode* rather than a rule, parity cannot be reached by translation.
kiro-cli's 42 "suspicious bash" patterns are audit-only; CC has no audit-only
mode, so they are deliberately **not** translated and the gap is recorded as a
known security gap rather than silently downgraded (companion). The
honest contract is a declared capability plus a documented gap. Note what CC's
selectability does to the rest of this bucket: every row marked (companion) —
the glob-to-regex translation, the stripping of an inherited `defaultMode`, the
unbeatable-rule detector — is protection a public build does **not** have, and the
inherited-config hazard row above is the one to read first, because it is where
CC's own engine can auto-approve without ever calling Crew's gate.

**A provider must declare:** where denial is enforced relative to the host gate,
its regex-engine class, its auto-approve vocabulary and default-when-absent
semantics, its permission-option vocabulary, how auto mode is expressed and
whether it is spawn-scoped, which of its own rules the host cannot override, and
whether tool titles carry a verb prefix.

## 8. Auxiliary runtimes the host cannot self-discover

| | kiro-cli | KAS | CC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary binary | `kiro-cli`, resolved by `_resolve_kiro_bin` | `kiro-cli` | `claude-agent-acp`, resolved via vendored `node_modules` / mise / PATH (`acp/client.py:158-178`, `:429-500`) |
| Additional runtime | none | none | a **second** native binary (~250 MB) that the adapter's SDK will not find itself; Crew injects `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` into the child env (`acp/client.py:2807-2822`) |
| Failure mode when missing | resolution error | resolution error | reported **before** a session by the install probe, which names which of the two halves is absent and, for the adapter, the `npm i -g` that fixes it (`agent_sdk/backend_install.py`); a session started anyway still dies at `session/new` with "Claude native binary not found" after a warning log (`acp/client.py:2807-2820`) |

The probe's answer is deliberately three-valued, and the third value is not
padding: a resolver that *fails* reports `unknown`, never `missing`, because
telling an operator to install what they may already have is the worse error. It
also discloses one skew it cannot fix — the adapter resolves on disk now, but the
running gateway already cached its absence for the process's lifetime, so the row
reads `installed` with `restart_required` rather than promising something that
then fails.

**A provider must declare:** every runtime it needs beyond its own entry point,
how each is discovered, and how a missing one is reported *before* a session is
attempted rather than during it. CC is the one backend that now answers the third
part, and its answer is the shape a new provider should copy: a probe that asks
through the spawn's own resolvers, one row per component so a half-install is
distinguishable, and a remedy named only where this repository actually
establishes one — the `claude` CLI reports an empty install command rather than an
invented one.

## Seam status today

| Bucket | Seam |
|---|---|
| 6 Usage / billing | real — consumers read a boolean flag |
| 7 Permission vocabulary | real — `acp/kas_permissions.py`, shared by the wire projection and the on-disk writer so they cannot drift |
| 1 Agent definition | partial — `acp/kas_agents.py` is a genuine projection; the *writer* (`agent.py`) has none |
| 3 Auth-store reading | weak — the projection is isolated, the paths and table names are inline constants |
| 4 Sandbox delegation | weak — one decision function, a hardcoded predicate |
| 2 Session persistence | **none** — the path is spelled literally in at least four modules |
| 5 MCP injection | **none** — an overridable method returning `[]` is the whole extension point, and now that CC is selectable that neutral default is what a public build actually runs |
| 7 Regex-engine parity | **none** — the deny catalog is authored against one engine |
| 8 Auxiliary runtimes | partial — `agent_sdk/backend_install.py` is a real preflight that names each absent component before a session, but the *requirement* is still declared nowhere a type checker can see: the probe knows CC needs two binaries because it was written to, not because CC declared it |

## New-provider checklist

A provider author must answer every "must declare" line above. Where the answer
is **"not supported"**, that is a valid declaration and the corresponding Crew
surface degrades rather than assuming. Silence is not an answer: the two failure
modes observed on the CC seam are a missing MCP override yielding a session with
zero tools, and a missing settings seed silently collapsing the context window
from 1M to 200K — both documented as comments rather than enforced by an
interface. Neither is hypothetical any more. CC is selectable on a public build,
so a public build reaches both, and a comment is not a thing an operator can
read.

## What supporting one foreign host costs today

Because none of the buckets above is a typed contract, the public core carries the
CC host seam as **live** conditional surface: reachable on a plain build, and
still driven by holes that nothing declares. Making CC selectable removed none of
the entries below — it removed only the argument that nobody could reach them. The
`getattr` seams, the neutral-return overrides and the sentinels are now on the
path a public build takes when an operator picks Claude Code.

| Kind | Count |
|---|---|
| `getattr`-by-name seams whose target the public core never defines | 2 (`acp/client.py:2742`, `:3351`) |
| Defensive attribute probes across the provider boundary | 4 |
| Methods returning a neutral value purely for a companion to override | 6 |
| `ClaudeCodeProvider is not None and isinstance(...)` guards against a name hard-coded to `None` | 11 sites, 2 sentinels (`session.py:200`, `subagent.py:144`) |
| Comment clusters naming the companion or a deleted module as the supplier | 19 |
| Refusal / downgrade mechanisms | 9, including one degrade log line (`config/loader.py:4647-4652`) and five capability non-memberships |
| Live `_is_claude` branches inside `acp/` | 13 |
| CC-symbol lines in `src/kiro_crew` | 146 (352 including `test/`) |

The counts are a point-in-time audit and drift with every edit to the surface they
measure, as do the line numbers beside them; the symbols are the durable
reference, and a reader checking a number should re-derive it rather than trust
it.

The registration seam itself is coherent —
`ProviderRegistry.register_acp_backends` / `create_factory`
(`platform/interfaces.py:66-90`), a documented no-op default
(`platform/defaults.py:41-48`), one wiring site (`platform/bootstrap.py:220-229`),
and an explicit rule that the core never imports the companion. Its *purpose* has
narrowed, though: with the baseline covering every known backend, an edition needs
it only for a harness the core does not ship at all, not to make a shipped one
reachable. Everything below it is still incoherent: the behaviour a companion must
supply is delivered through three different kinds of undeclared hole, none
type-checked and none failing loudly when omitted.
