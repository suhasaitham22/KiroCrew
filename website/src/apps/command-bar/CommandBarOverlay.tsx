/**
 * Command Bar — the ⌘K launcher.

 *
 * The shape it is built around: the FIRST PAGE is a launcher over rows already in
 * memory (commands, app destinations, quicklinks, settings) and never queries a
 * backend, so typing in it costs nothing no matter how much history the instance
 * holds. A content search is a ROW you enter — entering it is the activation
 * event that lets that engine run its first query. The previous surface fanned
 * every keystroke out to every provider, which is why typing could stall the
 * gateway's event loop; here a keystroke in the root has nothing to fan out to.
 *
 * No prefix sigils: the entry gesture is Enter on a row, and habit (frecency
 * ranking) is what makes a frequent row reachable in one or two keystrokes.
