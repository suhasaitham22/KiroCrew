// useVirtualChat — measurement-first chat virtualizer hook.

// Composes HeightCache (persistent), WindowCalculator (pure window math),
// FollowController (pure stick-to-bottom decisions), and DOM observers
// (Intersection + Resize) to render a windowed view of `items`.
//
// FOLLOW / STICK-TO-BOTTOM
// ========================
// A single `stickRef` boolean is the source of truth for "keep the viewport
// pinned to the bottom". It is owned entirely by this hook (callers just use
// `scrollToBottom()` / `isAtBottom`). The decision logic lives in
// FollowController as pure functions and is race-proof against the
// ResizeObserver-vs-scroll-event ordering — see that module's header for the
// rationale. The two write sites are:
//   - automatic pins (RO callback + append layout effect) → `pinAuto()`
//   - explicit pins (slot entry + scrollToBottom API) → `forcePin()`
//
// INVARIANT — every programmatic `scrollTop` write MUST record itself in
// `lastWriteTopRef`. Read this before adding any code that moves the scroller.
//
// The stick-release guard distinguishes "the user scrolled" from "we scrolled"
// by comparing live `scrollTop` against the value we last wrote. An unrecorded
// write therefore looks exactly like user input and releases follow. The guard
// is reliable only because pins are instant, so there is no in-flight animation
// to desynchronise the reference. That makes the invariant load-bearing rather
// than hygienic: the anchor-compensation write has to honour it too, and so must
// any future one.
//
// Visual stability while scrolled up (window expansion, async widget resizes
// above the viewport) uses native CSS `overflow-anchor: auto` PLUS an explicit
// anchor-preservation pass: an upward window shift can unmount the very node the
// browser chose as its anchor, which resets anchoring and jumps the viewport, so
// the top visible row's offset is captured before the commit and `scrollTop` is
// compensated after it. The CSS is retained — reliance on it is reduced, not
// replaced.
//
// Render contract for callers:
//   - Wrap the scroll container with `scrollerRef`
//   - Render the items in `virtualItems`: when `item.mounted` is true render
//     the real component wrapped in a div with `ref={measureRef(item.index)}`;
//     when false render a placeholder `<div style={{ height: item.height }} />`
//   - Place `topSentinelRef` / `bottomSentinelRef` at the list ends for
//     window expansion.
//
// WHY THIS IS IN-HOUSE (build-vs-buy — decided, not assumed)
// ==========================================================
// This module re-implements machinery that react-virtuoso and @tanstack/virtual
// ship battle-tested (dynamic measurement, prefix-sum offsets, follow-output
// pinning, anchor stability). Owning it is a deliberate maintainer decision
// rather than a default that accumulated. The chat-specific requirements a
// drop-in library does not cover today:
//   - Widget iframes: rows contain sandboxed iframes that lose all internal
//     state on unmount and rebuild slowly (PROGRAMMATIC_BUILD_DELAY_MS), which
//     is why `isSticky` exists to exempt chosen rows from windowing entirely.
//   - Identity that is not the array index: a steered bubble's `ts` is rewritten
//     by the server echo, so height-cache identity must key on `meta.clientTs`
//     (see ChatPage `stableMsgKey`); a library keyed on index or item identity
//     would orphan the measurement.
//   - Turn regrouping: a `single` row promotes into a grouped `turn` mid-stream,
//     changing row composition without changing the underlying messages.
//   - Cross-session persistence: heights survive in localStorage per session,
//     partitioned by `sessionId`, so a revisit is warm.
// None of these is proven *fundamental* — they are integration costs, not
// impossibilities, so the decision is revisitable and this list is what any
// future migration would have to satisfy. Such a revisit should weigh that
// react-virtuoso is already a dependency serving other virtualized surfaces, so
// the question is convergence between two strategies rather than first-time
// adoption.
//
// The decision carries one obligation, and it is now DISCHARGED. Height truth
// spans the DOM, `HeightCache`, the offset tree and the geometry derived from
// them; it used to stay coherent by convention -- a hand-bumped version counter
// in memo dependency arrays, plus a session guard held separately by the cache
// and by the tree. `HeightIndex` now owns all of it:
//   - it holds the cache and the tree, and is the only surface this hook reads
//     heights through, so the two-readers seam and the duplicated session guard
//     are gone (one guard, and the tree cannot outlive its cache);
//   - it announces a geometry change in the same call that mutates the tree, so
//     the invalidation is subscribed to rather than maintained by hand -- there
//     is no bump site left to forget.

  /**
   * ONE compensation routine, FIVE triggers, ONE capture point.
   *
   *   TRIGGER 1 — prepend (load-older history): every index shifts up, so
   *     pre-existing rows move down by the inserted height.
   *   TRIGGER 2 — upward window shift (scroll recompute / top-sentinel
   *     expansion): rows mount above the viewport, and they are re-measured
   *     from the flat estimate, so the content above the reader changes height.
   *   TRIGGER 3 — tail append (a new message arrives while the reader is
   *     scrolled up): nothing is inserted above them, but the growth re-syncs
   *     the offset tree, and every row that has never been measured is
   *     re-priced from the running MEAN of the measured ones — so the height
   *     credited above the reader changes anyway and the transcript slides
   *     (measured in the harness: a row at screen offset 0 landed at 500).
   *   TRIGGER 4 — mid-list INSERT (a transient "thinking" row mounts between rows
   *     that are already on screen): the count grows and index 0 keeps its key,
   *     which reads exactly like TRIGGER 3, but every index from the splice point
   *     on MOVES. Left on trigger 3's path it anchored on a MIS-KEYED row,
   *     because that path resolves a mounted node's previous-commit index through
   *     the NEW items.
   *   TRIGGER 5 — mid-list REMOVE (that same row unmounts): the height above the
   *     reader SHRINKS and the transcript is pulled up under them. No trigger
   *     covered a shrink at all (issue #6076).
   *   TRIGGER 6 — mid-list SWAP: the thinking row leaves and its replacement
   *     arrives in ONE commit, which React batching makes the ordinary streaming
   *     shape. The net count is unchanged, so a count-delta trigger reads it as a
   *     no-op. It participates in the height RETIREMENT below but deliberately
   *     captures NO anchor: the single consumer is invalidated by `windowRange`
   *     and `itemCount`, and an equal-count swap moves neither, so an anchor
   *     taken here would sit in the slot and be spent on an unrelated later
   *     commit — the exact stranded-anchor hazard the render-phase capture
   *     exists to remove. Compensating it needs a new invalidation key in that
   *     consumer, which is its own change; tracked in #7234.
   *
   * All five are "the height above the reader changed"; the correction is
   * identical, so they share this slot and the single consumer below. A parallel
   * path would fight this one for `scrollTop`, which is why append folds in here
   * rather than getting an anchor slot of its own.
   *
   * The capture is in the RENDER phase (getSnapshotBeforeUpdate idiom) for ALL.
   * That point is canonical rather than merely convenient: a post-commit read
   * cannot recover a pre-shift position — the row has already moved and the
   * delta reads zero — while a pre-shift capture is valid for the window shift
   * too, because the mounted nodes still carry the PREVIOUS commit's geometry
   * while the new range renders. Capturing here also removes the stale-anchor
   * hazard the callback capture had: an anchor taken when a shift was merely
   * SCHEDULED outlived a no-op window commit and was then applied to an
   * unrelated later one, yanking the viewport to a row nobody was reading.
   *
   * Arithmetic is no alternative: `getH` prices an unmeasured row from the
   * running MEAN of measured ones, so any measurement re-prices every unmeasured
   * row and the next sync re-reads them all (measured: a 1000px insert displaced
   * rows by 1500).
   *
   * Staged, because trigger 1 needs an extra commit before it can measure:
   *   'awaiting-rebase' — prepend captured; the window must be re-based first
   *                       (part 1) so the anchor row is still mounted to measure.
   *   'rebased'         — re-base committed; correct, then re-derive the window.
