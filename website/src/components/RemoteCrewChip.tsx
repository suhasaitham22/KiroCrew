/**
 * The marker that a session's turns run on ANOTHER MACHINE.
 *
 * Two consumers share this one definition on purpose. A federated *search* row
 * (a session that lives on a peer) and a local row bound to a peer for execution
 * are different things internally, but to the person reading the sidebar they
 * make the same claim — "this is not on my machine" — and a user who learned the
 * marker in one list must recognise it in the other.
 *
 * Why it is not the neutral meta chip every sibling uses: "runs on another
 * machine" is a different KIND of fact from "has this tag", and at neutral
 * weight it read as just another tag. The info tint raises it without shouting.
 *
 * The glyph is the non-colour half of the cue, so the distinction survives a
 * colour-vision deficiency, and it is `aria-hidden` because the crew name beside
 * it already names the target — a screen reader would otherwise announce a
 * decorative icon before the only informative part.
