/**
 * Deterministic avatar for a crew, with an optional per-crew override.
 *
 * By default the seed is the crew name, so a crew keeps the same face forever
 * and two people looking at the same config see the same roster. A crew record
 * may instead pin explicit ghost traits (`avatar: {kind:'ghost', traits}`,
 * authored in the avatar builder); the pinned face is composed through the
 * same style module, so preview === roster === editor. Generation is fully
 * LOCAL — `@dicebear/core` renders the SVG in-process from the `kiroGhost`
 * style definition. Nothing is fetched, so this works offline and no crew name
 * ever leaves the machine (DiceBear's HTTP API is deliberately not used).
 *
 * Rendered as an `<img>` carrying a data URI rather than inlined SVG markup.
 * Two reasons, both load-bearing:
 *  - no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, so this stays clear of the frontend-security
 *    rule and there is no HTML-string path to audit;
 *  - inline DiceBear SVGs collide on their internal `id`s when several are on
 *    one page (clip paths resolve to whichever came first, which renders some
 *    styles blank). A data URI is its own document, so the problem cannot
 *    arise and `randomizeIds` is unnecessary.
 *
 * Swapping the art set is a one-line change to STYLE below; nothing outside
 * this file knows which style is in use.
