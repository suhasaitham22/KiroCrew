/**
 * Every theme's `--<tier>-fg` must be readable ON `--<tier>`.
 *
 * `bg-danger` + `text-danger-fg` (badges, buttons, and the Agents page meter
 * labels) trusts these pairs blindly — nothing in CSS can notice that a theme
 * paired white text with a pale fill. Two properties are pinned per pair:
 *
 * 1. **4.5:1 floor.** These labels are 12–13px, below WCAG's large-text size,
 *    so AA applies at 4.5:1 rather than 3:1.
 * 2. **No worse than `--text-strong`.** The meter labels previously painted
 *    `--text-strong` over the fill regardless. Reading the token is only an
 *    improvement if the token beats what it replaced — otherwise a theme is
 *    quietly made LESS readable by "fixing" it. This is the assertion that
 *    caught rosepine-light (`#d7827e` + white = 2.84:1, against 5.34:1 for
 *    text-strong) and kiro-light's undeclared `--danger-fg` (4.30:1 inherited
 *    from the dark defaults, since `:root` matches `<html>` in every theme).
 *
 * The CSS is parsed rather than rendered because jsdom resolves no cascade: it
 * would report every var as empty and the whole suite would pass vacuously.

/*
 * SCOPE: the three tiers the meter bars paint. `index.css` declares four more
 * `-fg` pairs (`ok`, `info`, `aim`, `muted`) with their own consumers, and they
 * are NOT covered here — deliberately, not by oversight. Measured at the time
 * this test was written: extending it would red `amoled-grey-calm-light` ok
 * (3.30:1), `amoled-midnight-light` ok (3.77:1) and `amoled-light` aim (4.13:1),
 * and `muted` fails in 20+ themes (`highcontrast-light` measures 1.32:1). Those
 * are real defects in their own right, but fixing them means editing tokens no
 * meter bar reads, so they belong to their own change rather than riding along
 * with this one.
